Viruses cause both colds and flu&nbsp;by increasing&nbsp;inflammation of the membranes in the nose and throat.</p> <p>Most transmission of these viruses occurs via hand-to-hand contact.</p> <h4>Symptoms</h4> <p>Flu symptoms come on suddenly and affect the body all over. Flu symptoms are usually more serious than a cold and&nbsp;include:</p> <ul> <li>fever (100&deg;&nbsp;F),</li> <li>headache,</li> <li>more intense pain and fatigue, and</li> <li>more severe, often&nbsp;dry cough.</li> </ul> <p>When you get the flu, you are also more prone to bronchitis, sinus, and ear infections.&nbsp;</p> <p>Cold symptoms mostly affect above the neck and include:</p> <ul> <li>a runny or stuffy nose (nasal congestion),</li> <li>sneezing,</li> <li>sore through, and</li> <li>cough.&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>You may also experience a mild headache, body aches or a low grade fever. Typically, a cold lasts&nbsp;2-14 days.</p> <h4>Treatment</h4> <p>If any problem is causing you discomfort, you should seek medical care.</p> <p>Seek medical attention promptly if you have:</p> <ul> <li>a fever of 102&deg;&nbsp;F or greater (which may indicate a more serious infection),</li> <li>a persisting cough, especially with a significant fever (which could indicate pneumonia),</li> <li>a persistent sore throat (especially if runny nose does not develop - which could indicate a strep infection), or</li> <li>any cold lasting more than 10 days.</li> </ul> <p>Because colds and flu are caused by viruses, they cannot be cured by antibiotics. There are tips to help you feel better and&nbsp;strengthen your immune system to fight illness:</p> <ul> <li>Rest more than usual and avoid exercise until symptoms are gone.</li> <li>Drink lots of clear fluids (e.g., water, tea).</li> <li>Stay away from cigarette smoke.</li> <li>Do not take antibiotics unless specifically prescribed for you to cure the illness from which you currently suffer.</li> <li>Avoid drinking alcohol because it weakens your immune system and may interact with medications.</li> <li>Avoid caffeine, which can increase congestion and dehydration.</li> <li>Eat a well-balanced diet, including fruits, vegetables, and grains.</li> </ul> <h4>More Specific Remedies for Comfort</h4> <h5>Runny Nose/Congestion:</h5> <ul> <li>Decongestants (e.g. pseudoephedrine) can relieve a runny nose and congestion, but these medications can inhibit sleep and suppress appetite.</li> <li>Salt water nasal sprays (e.g. NaSal or Ocean) can ease nasal congestion and thin mucus. However, excessive use of medicated nose sprays, like Afrin, can cause dependence and may make congestion worse.</li> <li>Humidifiers and hot showers can help to moisten nasal passages and clear mucus.</li> </ul> <h5>Cough:</h5> <ul> <li>Dextromethorphan is an effective cough suppressant, but because a cough is a protective reflex, it is not usually a bad thing. Take dextromethorphan if your cough is interfering with sleep or work.</li> <li>Water vapor from humidifiers and showers can help loosen the mucus causing a cough, as can chicken soup.</li> </ul> <h5>Sore Throat:</h5> <ul> <li>Phenol in lozenges and sprays is an effective pain reliever for sore throats.</li> <li>Gargling with warm saltwater (1 tsp. salt in one cup of warm water) every four hours may help ease pain by reducing swollen tonsils.</li> <li>Drinking tea with lemon (with or without honey).</li> </ul> <h5>Fever/Pain:</h5> <ul> <li>Acetaminophen, Aspirin, Ibuprofen. If symptoms are severe, you may alternate acetaminophen and ibuprofen every two hours for pain or fever relief.</li> </ul> <h4>Prevention</h4> <p>UHS offers flu shots to Princeton students at a reduced cost every fall. Even though getting a flu shot will not completely eliminate your chances of developing the flu, it will certainly reduce the risk. Each year, a new vaccine made from inactivated (killed) influenza viruses is formulated. Since it may take the immune system time to respond to the vaccination, the inactivated vaccine should be given 6 to 8 weeks before flu season begins in order to prevent infection or reduce the severity of the illness.</p> <p>The flu is probably only contagious during the first three days of illness, and the incubation period is 24-72 hours, meaning you might not show symptoms for three days after contracting the virus. It is rare to catch a cold virus through the air &ndash; most transmission occurs via hand-to-hand contact. To prevent colds, flu, and other illnesses, follow these tips:</p> <ul> <li>Wash your hands often (which is good advice for keeping healthy in any situation). Keep them away from your nose, eyes, and mouth. Use an instant hand sanitizer when you can&rsquo;t wash your hands.</li> <li>Get regular exercise and eat well.</li> <li>Follow good sleep habits.</li> <li>Get a flu shot each fall (offered to all students at a lower cost by UHS each fall)&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p> </div>','this is title','2023-07-09 11:05:43','2023-07-09 11:05:43',NULL),(3,2,NULL,'Diarrhea','<h3>Diarrhea</h3>\n<h4>Causes</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bacterial infection, caused by contaminated food or water</li>\n<li>Viral infection</li>\n<li>Parasites, which can enter the body through food or water</li>\n<li>Food intolerance, such as the inability to digest lactose, the sugar in milk</li>\n<li>Overuse of alcohol or laxatives</li>\n<li>Medication, such as some antibiotics or antacids containing magnesium</li>\n<li>Menstrual cramps</li>\n<li>Stress or a panic attack</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Symptoms</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>watery, loose stools</li>\n<li>frequent bowel movements</li>\n<li>cramping or pain in the abdomen, nausea, bloating</li>\n<li>possibly fever or bloody stools, depending on the cause</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Treatment</h4>\n<p>Usually diarrhea will clear up on its own in a day or two, but a prolonged case may cause complications. The most important concern is dehydration. If you have symptoms of dehydration, a fever above 102&deg; F, bloody stools (black and tarry), severe abdomen or rectum pain, or diarrhea lasting more than 3 days you should consult a physician. Here&rsquo;s some advice for taking care of diarrhea yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid foods that are milk-based, greasy, high-fiber, or very sweet because these are likely to aggravate diarrhea.</li>\n<li>Avoid caffeine and alcohol.</li>\n<li>Do not eat solid food if you have signs of dehydration (thirst, light-headed, dark urine). Instead, drink about 2 cups of clear fluids per hour (if vomiting isn&rsquo;t present), such as sports drinks and broth. Water alone is not enough because your body needs sodium and sugar to replace what it&rsquo;s losing.</li>\n<li>Avoid high sugar drinks, like apple juice, grape juice, and soda, which can pull water into the intestine and make the diarrhea persist.</li>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t drink clear liquids exclusively for more than 24 hours.</li>\n<li>Begin eating normal meals within 12 hours, but stick to food that is bland and won&rsquo;t irritate your intestine. Some doctors suggest the &ldquo;BRAT&ldquo; diet which includes foods that are low in fiber, fat, and sugar. BRAT stands for&nbsp;Bananas,&nbsp;Rice,&nbsp;Applesauce, and&nbsp;Toast.</li>\n<li>Use over-the-counter lactobacillus acidophilus capsules or tablets. These bacteria help maintain a healthy intestine, and are found in yogurt with live active cultures.</li>\n<li>Decrease level of exercise until symptoms are gone.</li>\n<li>Over-the-counter drugs, such as Imodium A-D, should only be used if absolutely necessary because it is important to let diarrhea flush out the bacteria or parasite that&rsquo;s causing the infection.</li>\n</ul>','Diarrhea','2023-07-09 11:05:43','2023-07-09 11:05:43',NULL),(4,3,NULL,'Headaches','<h3>Headaches</h3>\n<p>Everyone suffers the occasional mild headache, but if you experience debilitating pain and/or abnormally frequent headaches, you probably want to find relief. There are countless causes of headaches, which differ for each person, so you&rsquo;ll have to do some experimenting to figure out the cause of your pain. Fortunately, the vast majority of headaches are primary headaches, not the result of underlying medical conditions. The three most common types are cluster, tension-type, and migraine.</p>\n<p>A cluster headache affects a specific point of the head, often the eye, and is characterized by sharp, piercing pain. Migraine and tension-type headaches are far more common. &ldquo;Tension&ldquo; headaches are now called &ldquo;tension-type&ldquo; headaches because pain is not only caused by stress, but also poor posture, depression, and even sexual activity. In fact, recent studies have shown a connection between low serotonin levels and so-called &ldquo;tension&ldquo; headaches.</p>\n<h4>Causes</h4>\n<p>The cause of a headache is often elusive. Although it may seem that your head is pounding for no reason, there is always an explanation for pain. To find out the cause of your headaches, keep a log. Write down the date and time each headache starts and stops, the location of the pain, the nature and severity of the pain, and any factors that seem to trigger the headaches (food, stress, menstrual cycle, medicine, etc.).</p>\n<p>Some of the many causes of headaches:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Emotional and physical stress</li>\n<li>Fatigue</li>\n<li>Irregular sleep habits (sleeping too much or too little)</li>\n<li>Skipping meals</li>\n<li>Caffeine use or withdrawal</li>\n<li>Hormonal factors, such as menstruation</li>\n<li>Monosodium glutamate (MSG)</li>\n<li>Foods with nitrates, such as hot dogs</li>\n<li>Alcohol</li>\n<li>Some medicines</li>\n<li>Certain foods, including red wine, chocolate, aged cheeses, pickled foods, nuts, and aspartame</li>\n<li>Changes in weather, altitude, or time zone</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Symptoms</h4>\n<p>Just as the causes vary for each headache sufferer, so do the symptoms and severity of pain. Health professionals can often diagnose the type of headache you suffer based on your symptoms.</p>\n<p>Symptoms of a migraine:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>pulsing or throbbing quality</li>\n<li>begins with intense pain on one side of the head, which eventually spreads</li>\n<li>felt on one or both sides of the head</li>\n<li>lasts several hours</li>\n<li>severe enough to interfere with routine activities</li>\n<li>may be accompanied by nausea or vomiting</li>\n<li>sometimes preceded by visual changes, such as an aura of zigzag lines or flashes of light</li>\n<li>light and noise can make the headache worse, while sleep tends to relieve symptoms</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Symptoms of a tension-type headache:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>constant, dull ache</li>\n<li>felt on both sides of the head</li>\n<li>a feeling of squeezing or pressure</li>\n<li>does not usually interfere with routine activities</li>\n<li>lasts from 30 minutes to a few days</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Treatment</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Ice pack held over the eyes or forehead</li>\n<li>Heating pad set on low or hot shower to relax tense neck and shoulder muscles</li>\n<li>Sleep, or at least resting in a dark room</li>\n<li>Taking breaks from stressful situations</li>\n<li>Regular exercise to increase endorphin levels and relax muscles. Even if you already have a headache, exercising may relieve the pain. However, intense exercise may bring on a headache.</li>\n<li>Occasional use of over-the-counter medicines such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or aspirin can relieve both migraine and tension headaches. *</li>\n<li>Prescription drugs for severe headaches</li>\n</ul>\n<p>* Overuse of pain medicine can actually result in more frequent headaches. Most pain-relieving medicines used to treat headaches can cause &ldquo;analgesic rebound headaches&ldquo; if used too often.</p>\n<h4>Prevention</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Be aware of early symptoms so you can try to stop the headache as soon as it begins.</li>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t smoke, and if you do, quit.</li>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t skip meals.</li>\n<li>Cut down on caffeine and alcohol (reduce caffeine intake gradually because withdrawal may cause headaches).</li>\n<li>Stop all over-the-counter medicines and herbal remedies.</li>\n<li>Maintain a regular eating and sleeping schedule.</li>\n<li>Exercise regularly.</li>\n<li>Incorporate relaxation activities into your daily routine, such as meditation, yoga, stretching exercises, and massage</li>\n<li>Improve your posture, possibly by adjusting your workstation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>When should I see a health care provider?</h5>\n<p>Although most headaches do not signal underlying medical problems, if your headaches change in nature or location, or become more severe, frequent, and/or intense, you should consult your health care provider.</p>\n<p>Seek immediate medical attention if your headaches&hellip;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Become increasingly worse, and are most painful early in the morning while you are still in bed.</li>\n<li>Occur three or more times a week.</li>\n<li>Begin to be accompanied by nausea or vomiting.</li>\n<li>Occur after a head injury, especially if they get worse.</li>\n<li>Seem to be triggered by physical exertion, such as exercise, sexual activity, or coughing.</li>\n<li>Occur along with green or brown nasal drainage and sinus pain over the cheeks or around the eyes.</li>\n<li>Are accompanied by dizziness, difficulty speaking, vision loss, or numbness in an arm, leg, or parts of the face.</li>\n<li>Develop suddenly, accompanied by a fever over 101&deg;F and are not relieved by acetaminophen or aspirin, especially if there is pain or stiffness in the neck.</li>\n</ul>','Headaches','2023-07-09 11:05:43','2023-07-09 11:05:43',NULL),(5,4,NULL,'Allergies','<h3>Allergies</h3>\n<p>Allergies are an immune response triggered by allergens, an ordinarily harmful substance.</p>\n<h4>Causes</h4>\n<p>People with allergies have especially sensitive immune systems that react when they contact allergens.</p>\n<p>Common allergens include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>foods (nuts, eggs, milk, soy, shellfish, wheat)</li>\n<li>pollen</li>\n<li>mold</li>\n<li>latex</li>\n<li>pet dander</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Symptoms</h4>\n<p>Because there are so many possible causes, the symptoms of allergies vary widely.

Where unavoidable, some lifestyle changes can reduce your allergy symptoms. For example, if you are allergic to dust mites, make an effort to keep your room clean and free of dust by frequent vacuuming, dusting, and washing of bedding.</p>\n<p>For pollen allergies, avoid being outside when pollen counts are high and keep the windows to your room shut.</p>\n<p>Because it is very difficult to avoid certain allergens, medication may be necessary to lessen symptoms caused by allergens, other than food and drugs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Antihistamines</strong>: help relieve or prevent the sneezing, itchy eyes and throat, and postnasal drip that the allergen may cause.&nbsp;They are sold in many forms (i.e., pills, nasal sprays, liquids, etc.).</li>\n<li><strong>Decongestants:</strong>&nbsp;help reduce congestion in your nasal membranes by narrowing the blood vessels that supply those membranes. They can be purchased in several forms (liquid, pill or nasal spray) and may be used with an antihistamine or alone to treat nasal swelling related to allergies. &nbsp;Limit use of nasal sprays to fewer than two to three days in a row because prolonged use can cause the nasal membrane swells, resulting in severe nasal obstruction.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Anti-inflammatory agents (e.g., corticosteroid):</strong>&nbsp;help reduce swelling of the airways, nasal congestion and sneezing. Typically taken as a nasal spray. Some people report that corticosteroids irritate nasal passages.</li>\n<li><strong>Allergy shots:</strong>&nbsp;recommended for serious allergy sufferers, this series of shots are administered by a healthcare provider and contain small amounts of the allergens that cause you discomfort. The goal of allergy shots is to enable your immune system to build better defenses against allergens.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some allergies go away with age, but others are lifelong.</p>\n<h4>Prevention</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid the outdoors between 5-10 a.m. and save outside activities for late afternoon or after a heavy rain, when pollen levels are lower.</li>\n<li>Keep windows in your living spaces closed to lower exposure to pollen.</li>\n<li>To keep cool, use air conditioners and avoid using window and attic fans.</li>\n<li>Wear a medical alert bracelet or other means to communicate to others about your allergy in case of a reaction.</li>\n<li>Discuss a prescription for epinephrine (e.g., EpiPen) with your healthcare provider, if you have risk of serious allergic reaction.</li>\n<li>Review product labels carefully before buying or consuming any item</li>\n<li>Know what you are eating or drinking.</li>\n</ul>','Allergies','2023-07-09 11:05:43','2023-07-09 11:05:43',NULL),(6,5,NULL,'Conjunctivitis','<h1>Conjunctivitis:</h1>\n<h2>Symptoms of conjunctivitis</h2>\n<div >\n<p>The symptoms of conjunctivitis will depend on what\'s causing the condition.</p>\n<p>However,&nbsp;the two main symptoms are usually:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>eye redness &ndash; as a result of the inflammation and widening of the tiny blood vessels in the conjunctiva (the thin layer of cells covering the front of the eyes)</li>\n<li>a discharge &ndash; the conjunctiva contains thousands of cells that produce mucus and tiny glands that produce tears&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;inflammation causes the glands to become overactive, so that they produce more water and mucus</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Only one eye&nbsp;tends to be&nbsp;affected at first,&nbsp;but symptoms usually&nbsp;affect both eyes&nbsp;within a few hours.</p>\n<h2>Infective conjunctivitis</h2>\n<p>If you have infective conjunctivitis, you may also have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a burning sensation in your eyes</li>\n<li>a feeling of grit in&nbsp;your eyes</li>\n<li>a sticky coating on the eyelashes&nbsp;&ndash; usually when you first wake up in the morning</li>\n<li>an enlarged lymph node (gland) in front of the ear</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Allergic conjunctivitis</h2>\n<p>You may have itchy eyes&nbsp;if you have allergic conjunctivitis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The pattern of symptoms for allergic conjunctivitis depends on the substance you\'re allergic to.</p>\n<p><a >Allergies</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;pollen (<a>hay fever</a>) occur during certain parts of the year.

This is known as an allergic reaction.</p>\n<p>There are four main types of allergic conjunctivitis:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>seasonal allergic conjunctivitis</li>\n<li>perennial allergic conjunctivitis</li>\n<li>contact dermatoconjunctivitis</li>\n<li>giant papillary conjunctivitis</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Seasonal and perennial conjunctivitis</h3>\n<p>Seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis are usually caused by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>pollen from grass, trees or flowers</li>\n<li>dust mites</li>\n<li>flakes of dead animal skin</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These types of conjunctivitis are more common in people who also have other allergies, such as&nbsp;<a>asthma</a>,&nbsp;and often occur with&nbsp;allergic rhinitis.</p>\n<h3>Contact dermatoconjunctivitis</h3>\n<p>Contact dermatoconjunctivitis is&nbsp;usually caused by eye drops, but it can also be caused by make-up or chemicals.</p>\n<h3>Giant papillary conjunctivitis</h3>\n<p>Giant papillary conjunctivitis is caused by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>contact lenses</li>\n<li>stitches used in eye surgery</li>\n<li>a prostheses (artificial) part of the eye that\'s fitted during eye surgery</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Giant papillary conjunctivitis is estimated to affect around 1-5% of people who use soft contact lenses and 1% of people who use hard contact lenses.</p>\n<h2>Irritant conjunctivitis</h2>\n<p>Irritant conjunctivitis can have a wide range of potential causes. Some common causes include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>chlorinated water used in swimming pools&nbsp;</li>\n<li>shampoo</li>\n<li>a stray eyelash rubbing against the conjunctiva</li>\n<li>smoke or fumes</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Diagnosing conjunctivitis</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Your GP should be able to diagnose conjunctivitis by asking about your symptoms and examining your eyes.</p>\n<p>Describing how your conjunctivitis started can help your GP diagnose which type it is and decide whether it needs to be treated.</p>\n<p>The most common symptoms of infective conjunctivitis are sticky, red and watery eyes. However, infective conjunctivitis can sometimes be confused with other types of conjunctivitis, which are treated differently.</p>\n<h2>Swab test</h2>\n<p>Your GP may suggest further tests, such as a swab test, if your conjunctivitis hasn\'t responded to treatment, or to help decide what treatment to use. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>A swab looks similar to a cotton bud. It\'s used to collect a small sample of mucus from your infected eye, which is sent to&nbsp;a laboratory to find out the cause of your conjunctivitis.</p>\n<p>If your symptoms are severe or don\'t respond to treatment, you may need to see an eye specialist (ophthalmologist).</p>\n<h2>Other conditions</h2>\n<p>Most cases of&nbsp;conjunctivitis clear up within&nbsp;one to&nbsp;two&nbsp;weeks without needing any medical treatment. In some cases, it can last for longer than two weeks, which is known as persistent infective conjunctivitis.</p>\n<p>If you have any unusual symptoms, such as severe pain, blurred vision or sensitivity to light, it may mean that you have a more serious condition.</p>\n<p>If you have any of these symptoms, it\'s very important to seek medical assistance immediately, either by contacting your GP or going to your nearest hospital.</p>\n<p>Other more serious&nbsp;conditions include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>acute glaucoma &ndash;&nbsp;a rare form of glaucoma that causes a painful build-up of pressure in your eye</li>\n<li>keratitis &ndash; where the cornea (the clear layer at the front of your eye) becomes swollen and develops open sores</li>\n<li>iritis &ndash;&nbsp;a type of&nbsp;uveitis (swelling of the middle layer of your eye) that causes pain,&nbsp;<a>headaches</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;watery eyes</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Newborn babies</h2>\n<p>Contact your GP straight away if you think your baby may have infective conjunctivitis (also called neonatal conjunctivitis).</p>\n<p>If this isn\'t possible, call&nbsp;NHS 24\'s \'<a href=\"tel:111\">111</a>\' service&nbsp;or your local out-of-hours service. Your GP will examine your baby closely to see if they have sticky eyes or infective conjunctivitis.</p>\n<p>All newborn babies with infective conjunctivitis must be referred to an eye specialist straight away for treatment.</p>\n<h2>Treating conjunctivitis</h2>\n<div class=\"editor\">\n<p>The recommended treatment for conjunctivitis will depend on whether it\'s caused by infection, an allergic reaction or an irritant, such as a stray eyelash.</p>\n<p>Each treatment option is discussed in more detail below.</p>\n<h2>Infective conjunctivitis</h2>\n<p>Most cases of infective conjunctivitis don\'t need medical treatment and clear up in one to two weeks.</p>\n<h3>Self care</h3>\n<p>There are several ways you can treat infective conjunctivitis at home. The advice below&nbsp;should help ease your symptoms.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove your contact lenses&nbsp;&ndash; if you wear contact lenses, take them out until all the symptoms of the infection have gone; don\'t re-use old lenses after the infection has gone because they could be a potential source of re-infection; always use new lenses, solutions and cases after an infection.</li>\n<li>Use lubricant eye drops &ndash; these are available over the counter at pharmacies or they may be prescribed for you; they may help ease any soreness and stickiness in your eyes; always follow the manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions.</li>\n<li>Gently clean away sticky discharge from your eyelids and lashes using cotton wool soaked in water.</li>\n<li>Wash your hands regularly &ndash; this is particularly important after touching your eyes and will stop the infection spreading to others.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Antibiotics</h3>\n<p><a>Antibiotics</a>&nbsp;aren\'t usually prescribed for infective conjunctivitis because it usually clears up by itself and there\'s a very low risk of complications for untreated conjunctivitis.</p>\n<p>However, if the infection is particularly severe or it has lasted for more than two weeks, you may be prescribed antibiotics. Some schools or playgroups may insist that a child is treated with antibiotics before they can return, although this is rare.</p>\n<p>Chloramphenicol and&nbsp;fusidic acid are the two main types of antibiotics that may be prescribed.</p>\n<h3>Chloramphenicol</h3>\n<p>Chloramphenicol is usually the first choice of antibiotic and comes in the form of eye drops. It\'s available without a prescription from pharmacies to treat bacterial conjunctivitis.</p>\n<p>Chloramphenicol needs to be used carefully to get the best results, so make sure you follow the advice of your pharmacist about how and when to use it, or check the patient information leaflet that comes with the medication so you know how to use it properly.</p>\n<p>If eye drops aren\'t suitable for you, you may be prescribed the antibiotic as an eye ointment instead.</p>\n<h3>Fusidic acid</h3>\n<p>Fusidic acid&nbsp;may be prescribed if chloramphenicol isn\'t suitable for you. It\'s often better for children and elderly people because it doesn\'t need to be used as often. It\'s also the preferred treatment for pregnant women.</p>\n<p>Like&nbsp;chloramphenicol, fusidic acid comes in the form of eye drops and should be used as advised by your doctor or as described in the instructions that come with the medication.</p>\n<h3>Side effects</h3>\n<p>Eye drops can briefly cause&nbsp;blurred&nbsp;vision. Avoid driving or operating machinery straight after using eye drops.</p>\n<p>Chloramphenicol and fusidic acid can also cause other side effects, such as a slight stinging or burning sensation in your eye, although this shouldn\'t last long.</p>\n<h3>Further treatment</h3>\n<p>It\'s very important to go back&nbsp;to your GP if you still have symptoms after two weeks. You should also contact your GP immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>eye pain</li>\n<li>sensitivity to light (photophobia)</li>\n<li>loss of vision</li>\n<li>intense redness in one eye or both eyes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your GP may recommend that you\'re tested for&nbsp;<a>sexually transmitted infections (STIs)</a>. Some STIs, such as chlamydia, can cause infective conjunctivitis. If this is the case, your symptoms may last for several months.</p>\n<h2>Allergic conjunctivitis</h2>\n<p>Your treatment will depend on the type of allergic conjunctivitis you have.</p>\n<p>The four main types of allergic conjunctivitis are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>seasonal conjunctivitis &ndash; typically caused by an allergy to pollen</li>\n<li>perennial conjunctivitis &ndash; usually caused by an allergy to dust mites or pets</li>\n<li>contact dermatoconjunctivitis &ndash; usually caused by an allergy to eye drops or cosmetics</li>\n<li>giant papillary conjunctivitis &ndash; usually caused by an allergy to contact lenses</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whatever the cause, you\'ll find that some self-help methods can ease your symptoms.</p>\n<h3>Self care</h3>\n<p>If you have allergic conjunctivitis, you can follow the guidelines below to treat your condition at home.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you wear contact lenses, take them out until all the signs and symptoms of the conjunctivitis have gone.</li>\n<li>Don\'t rub your eyes, even though they may be itchy. Rubbing your eyes can make your symptoms worse.</li>\n<li>Place a cool compress over your eyes.&nbsp;Wetting a flannel with cool water and holding it over your eyes will help ease your symptoms.</li>\n<li>Avoid exposure to the allergen, if possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis</h3>\n<p>If you have seasonal or perennial conjunctivitis, you may be prescribed the following medicines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>antihistamines&nbsp;</li>\n<li>mast cell stabilisers</li>\n<li><a>corticosteroids</a>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are described in more detail below.</p>\n<h3>Antihistamines</h3>\n<p>If allergic conjunctivitis needs rapid relief, your GP will probably prescribe a medicine known as an antihistamine.</p>\n<p>Antihistamines work by blocking the action of the chemical histamine, which the body releases when it thinks it\'s under attack from an allergen. This prevents the symptoms of the allergic reaction occurring.</p>\n<h3>Antihistamine eye drops</h3>\n<p>You may be prescribed antihistamine eye drops, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>azelastine&nbsp;(not suitable for children under four years of age)</li>\n<li>emedastine&nbsp;(not suitable for children under three years of age)</li>\n<li>ketotifen&nbsp;(not suitable for children under three years of age)</li>\n<li>antazoline with xylometazoline (Otrivine-Antistin, not suitable for children under 12 years of age)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Antazoline with xylometazoline (Otrivine-Antistin) is also available over the counter from pharmacies without prescription. Always follow the manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions.</p>\n<p>If you\'re pregnant or breastfeeding, some antihistamine eye drops may not be suitable.&nbsp;Speak to your GP for advice. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Oral antihistamines</h3>\n<p>You may be prescribed an antihistamine such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>cetirizine</li>\n<li>fexofenadine</li>\n<li>loratadine</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You\'ll usually only have to take an antihistamine once a day.</p>\n<p>If possible, oral antihistamines shouldn\'t be taken if you\'re pregnant or breastfeeding. Speak to your GP for advice.</p>\n<p>Although new antihistamines shouldn\'t make you drowsy, they may still have a sedating effect. This is&nbsp;more likely if you take high doses or drink alcohol while you\'re taking antihistamines.</p>\n<h3>Mast cell stabilisers</h3>\n<p>Mast cell stabilisers are an alternative type of medicine. Unlike antihistamines, they won\'t provide rapid symptom relief, but they are better at controlling your symptoms over a longer period of time.</p>\n<p>It may take several weeks to feel the effects of a mast cell stabiliser, so you may also be prescribed an antihistamine to take at the same time.</p>\n<p>Mast cell stabilisers that are commonly prescribed in the form of eye drops include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>lodoxamide</li>\n<li>nedocromil sodium</li>\n<li>sodium cromoglicate</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Corticosteroids</h3>\n<p>If your symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis are particularly severe, you may be prescribed a short course of&nbsp;topical corticosteroids (a cream, gel or ointment). However, these aren\'t usually prescribed unless absolutely necessary.</p>\n<h2>Giant papillary conjunctivitis</h2>\n<p>As giant papillary conjunctivitis is usually caused by contact lenses, the symptoms often clear up after you stop wearing them. The spots that form on the inside of your upper eyelid may last slightly longer.</p>\n<p>If you develop giant papillary conjunctivitis as a result of recent eye surgery, you\'ll be immediately referred to an ophthalmologist. This is so that your eyes can be carefully monitored and the most effective treatment given.</p>\n<h2>Irritant conjunctivitis</h2>\n<p>Most cases of irritant conjunctivitis don\'t need any treatment, as the condition should clear up once the irritant is removed from the eye.</p>\n<p>An exception to this is if your eyes were exposed to harmful substances such as bleach or acid. This is usually regarded as a medical emergency and you\'ll need to be admitted to hospital so your eyes can be washed out with saline solution.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>','Conjunctivitis','2023-07-09 11:05:43','2023-07-09 11:05:43',NULL),(7,6,NULL,'Mononucleosis','<h3>Mononucleosis</h3>\n<h4>Cause</h4>\n<p>Mononucleosis is an illness caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which is spread through saliva.</p>\n<h4>Symptoms</h4>\n<p>The most well known symptom of &ldquo;mono&ldquo; is extreme fatigue, forcing the infected person to nap frequently. If you experience such extreme fatigue accompanied by other symptoms, such as swollen lymph glands and spleen, sore throat, fever, loss of appetite, and muscle aches, you may want to get tested for mono. The basis for testing whether you have mono is the presence of antibodies produced by white blood cells. Many people infected with mono don&rsquo;t get sick, or have such mild symptoms they don&rsquo;t know they have it. EBV is usually in the body 30-50 days before an infected person develops symptoms. Surprisingly, 80-95% of adults in the US have been infected by the time they&rsquo;re 40, but only about 20% know they&rsquo;ve had mono.</p>\n<h4>Treatment</h4>\n<p>Mono is a virus, so antibiotics won&rsquo;t help. Make sure you get plenty of rest, eat healthy foods, avoid alcohol (because your liver may be inflamed and drinking weakens immune responses), drink plenty of fluids, take aspirin or an aspirin substitute to reduce pain and fever, gargle salt water to relieve sore throat, and avoid strenuous activity. Because your spleen may be swollen, it is important not to engage in contact sports which could rupture your spleen. Returning to normal activity too quickly increases your chances of relapse.</p>\n<h4>Prevention</h4>\n<p>Avoiding someone with mono can be hard because infected individuals often do not show symptoms. Because the incubation period is so long, a person can be contagious 1-2 months before showing any symptoms, and some people don&rsquo;t show symptoms at all. Even after signs of mono have disappeared, a person may still be producing the virus. A strong immune system, maintained by healthy diet, exercise, and adequate sleep, can help you from getting ill. Fortunately, mono is not very contagious, and is usually only passed through intimate contact, such as kissing.</p>','Mononucleosis','2023-07-09 11:05:43','2023-07-09 11:05:43',NULL),(8,7,NULL,'Stomach Aches','<h3>Stomach Aches</h3>\n<h4>Intestinal Gas</h4>\n<p>It&rsquo;s natural to have gas in your digestive tract, and to pass gas regularly. In fact, everyone passes gas at least 12 times a day, which is a combination of oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane. The unpleasant odor of flatus is cause by gases (e.g. hydrogen sulfide) produced by the bacteria in the large intestine. Even though it&rsquo;s natural to have gas in your digestive tract, excessive gas can cause intense, temporary pain. People who suffer discomfort from gas in the intestine report abdominal bloating, flatulence, and jabbing pains or cramps in the abdomen. Intestinal gas can mimic the pain associated with real illnesses, like gallbladder disease, heart disease, and appendicitis, but be aware that it can also signal other illnesses, such as stomach flu or food poisoning.</p>\n<p>The best treatment for gas focuses on the cause. Although there are several over-the-counter medications that advertise gas relief, they do not work for everyone and may have side effects. Medications that have been shown to effectively reduce gas use simethicone, a substance that helps gas be expelled through belching or passing flatus (it does not make gas dissolve or disappear). Activated charcoal preparations may also be helpful. While these medications are good for short-term immediate relief, the best step for long-term comfort is to find out what causes you gas.</p>\n<p>There are two general causes of gas: swallowed air and the breakdown of undigested foods by harmless bacteria in the large intestine. Everyone swallows air when they eat and drink, but these activities are likely to increase the amount ingested:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Eating or drinking rapidly</li>\n<li>Drinking through a straw</li>\n<li>Chewing gum or eating hard candy</li>\n<li>Smoking</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Food triggers vary from person to person, but the types of food that seem to cause the most problems are those that are high in fiber or lactose. Foods that may cause gas include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Beans</li>\n<li>Peas</li>\n<li>Lentils</li>\n<li>Cabbage</li>\n<li>Broccoli</li>\n<li>Brussels sprouts</li>\n<li>Milk products (if you lack adequate amounts of the enzyme lactase)</li>\n<li>Onions</li>\n<li>Wheat</li>\n<li>Carbonated beverages</li>\n<li>Sorbitol (artificial sweetener) and fructose (found in corn syrup)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To prevent gas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid foods that trigger gas.</li>\n<li>Avoid swallowing excess air by not chewing gum or eating hard candy.</li>\n<li>Take digestive enzyme supplements, such as Beano (for high-fiber foods) and lactase supplements (for milk products).</li>\n<li>Eat only small amounts of dairy products with food, if you suspect lactose intolerance.</li>\n<li>Eat several small meals throughout the day instead of two or three larger ones.</li>\n<li>Eat slowly, in a relaxed setting, and chew your food thoroughly.</li>\n<li>Take a stroll after meals. Don&rsquo;t sit in a slumped position or lie down after eating.</li>\n<li>If increasing the fiber in your diet, do so gradually</li>\n<li>Exercise to facilitate the passage of gas through the digestive tract.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Nausea and Vomiting</h4>\n<p>Possible causes for nausea and/or vomiting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Viruses in the intestines (viral gastroenteritis, see below)</li>\n<li>Some medications, such as certain antibiotics and birth control pills</li>\n<li>Eating too much or eating spoiled food</li>\n<li>Drinking too much (e.g. alcohol)</li>\n<li>Motion sickness</li>\n<li>Morning sickness in pregnant females</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Medical conditions that cause vomiting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Labrynthitis &ndash; inflammation of an area in the ear that usually results from an upper respiratory infection</li>\n<li>Concussion from a head injury</li>\n<li>Stomach ulcers</li>\n<li>Hepatitis (inflammation of the liver)</li>\n<li>Meningitis (inflammation of the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Gastroenteritis, a.k.a. &ldquo;stomach flu,&ldquo; is an inflammation of the intestines that can be caused by viruses, parasites, bacteria, food allergies, overuse of alcohol, and psychological reactions. Viruses that cause gastroenteritis can enter the intestine from contaminated food or water, or through contact with an infected person. Many different viruses can infect the intestine, but the signs and symptoms of gastroenteritis are generally the same: abdominal cramps, watery diarrhea and nausea and/or vomiting. Symptoms of gastroenteritis can develop anywhere from a few hours to a few days after contamination. Most cases resolve within a couple days without specific treatment, but some may last for up to 10 days. In addition to avoiding food and water that might be contaminated, you should wash your hands thoroughly and frequently (especially because viruses often enter the body through the fecal-oral route, when people do not wash their hands thoroughly after bowel movements). Because stomach flu is contagious, avoid sharing eating utensils, drinks, towels, and other objects that may transmit the virus from one person to another.</p>\n<p>The biggest health risk posed by gastroenteritis is dehydration. If you exhibit signs of dehydration, including extreme thirst, dry mouth, dark urine, dizziness, and severe weakness, get medical help immediately. If you cannot replace lost fluids through sipping clear liquids, you may need intravenous fluids and hospitalization.</p>\n<p>Self-care tips for vomiting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wait 30-60 minutes after vomiting before drinking anything to let your stomach settle.</li>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t eat solid foods. Don&rsquo;t drink milk.</li>\n<li>Drink clear liquids, taking small sips. Stir any carbonated beverages to get all the bubbles out before sipping them. Suck on ice chips if nothing else will stay down.</li>\n<li>Gradually return to regular diet, but wait about 8 hours from the last time you vomited. Start with foods like dry toast, crackers, rice, and other foods that are easy to digest.</li>\n<li>Avoid substances that irritate the stomach, like alcohol, aspirin, and fried foods.</li>\n<li>Avoid diuretics, like caffeine and alcohol, that contribute to fluid loss.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For nausea without vomiting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drink clear liquids. Eat small amounts of dry foods, such as soda crackers, if tolerated.</li>\n<li>Avoid things that irritate the stomach, such as alcohol, aspirin, spicy, and fried foods.</li>\n<li>For motion sickness, use an over-the-counter anti-nausea medicine, such as Dramamine.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>When should I see a health care provider?</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>If you can&rsquo;t keep liquids down for more than 24 hours</li>\n<li>If you have blood in vomit or stools</li>\n<li>If you&rsquo;re vomiting for more than 1 day</li>\n<li>If you have signs of dehydration (dry mouth, dark urine, dizziness, etc.)</li>\n<li>If you have a fever of more than 100&deg; F</li>\n<li>If vomiting is accompanied by a sore neck and severe headache</li>\n</ul>','Stomach Aches','2023-07-09 11:05:43','2023-07-09 11:05:43',NULL),(9,8,NULL,'Anemia','<h1><a>Anemia</a></h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Diagnosis</h2>\n<p>To diagnose anemia, your doctor is likely to ask you about your medical and family history, perform a physical exam, and run the following tests:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Complete blood count (CBC).</strong>&nbsp;A&nbsp;CBC&nbsp;is used to count the number of blood cells in a sample of your blood. For anemia, your doctor will be interested in the levels of the red blood cells contained in your blood (hematocrit) and the hemoglobin in your blood.</p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<p>Normal adult hematocrit values vary among medical practices but are generally between 40% and 52% for men and 35% and 47% for women. Normal adult hemoglobin values are generally 14 to 18 grams per deciliter for men and 12 to 16 grams per deciliter for women.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>A test to determine the size and shape of your red blood cells.</strong>&nbsp;Some of your red blood cells might also be examined for unusual size, shape and color.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Additional diagnostic tests</h3>\n<p>If you receive a diagnosis of anemia, your doctor might order additional tests to determine the cause. Occasionally, it can be necessary to study a sample of your bone marrow to diagnose anemia.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Treatment</h2>\n<p>Anemia treatment depends on the cause.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Iron deficiency anemia.</strong>&nbsp;Treatment for this form of anemia usually involves taking iron supplements and changing your diet.</p>\n<p>If the cause of iron deficiency is loss of blood &mdash; other than from menstruation &mdash; the source of the bleeding must be located and the bleeding stopped. This might involve surgery.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Vitamin deficiency anemias.</strong>&nbsp;Treatment for folic acid and vitamin C deficiency involves dietary supplements and increasing these nutrients in your diet.</p>\n<p>If your digestive system has trouble absorbing vitamin B-12 from the food you eat, you might need vitamin B-12 shots. At first, you might have the shots every other day. Eventually, you\'ll need shots just once a month, possibly for life, depending on your situation.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Anemia of chronic disease.</strong>&nbsp;There\'s no specific treatment for this type of anemia. Doctors focus on treating the underlying disease. If symptoms become severe, a blood transfusion or injections of a synthetic hormone normally produced by your kidneys (erythropoietin) might help stimulate red blood cell production and ease fatigue.</li>\n<li><strong>Aplastic anemia.</strong>&nbsp;Treatment for this anemia can include blood transfusions to boost levels of red blood cells.

It\'s important to find out what\'s causing your low blood pressure so that it can be treated.</p>\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\n<p>For some people, low blood pressure signals an underlying problem, especially when it drops suddenly or is accompanied by signs and symptoms such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dizziness or lightheadedness</li>\n<li>Fainting</li>\n<li>Blurred or fading vision</li>\n<li>Nausea</li>\n<li>Fatigue</li>\n<li>Lack of concentration</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Shock</h3>\n<p>Extreme hypotension can result in this life-threatening condition. Signs and symptoms include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Confusion, especially in older people</li>\n<li>Cold, clammy, pale skin</li>\n<li>Rapid, shallow breathing</li>\n<li>Weak and rapid pulse</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>When to see a doctor</h3>\n<p>If you have signs or symptoms of shock, seek emergency medical help.</p>\n<p>If you have consistently low blood pressure readings but feel fine, your doctor will likely just monitor you during routine exams.</p>\n<p>Even occasional dizziness or lightheadedness may be a relatively minor problem &mdash; the result of mild dehydration from too much time in the sun or a hot tub, for example. Still, it\'s important to see your doctor if you have signs or symptoms of low blood pressure because they can point to more-serious problems. It can be helpful to keep a record of your symptoms, when they occur and what you\'re doing at the time.</p>\n<h2>Causes</h2>\n<p>Blood pressure is a measurement of the pressure in your arteries during the active and resting phases of each heartbeat.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Systolic pressure.</strong>&nbsp;The top number in a blood pressure reading is the amount of pressure your heart produces when pumping blood through your arteries to the rest of your body.</li>\n<li><strong>Diastolic pressure.</strong>&nbsp;The bottom number in a blood pressure reading refers to the amount of pressure in your arteries when your heart is at rest between beats.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Current guidelines identify normal blood pressure as lower than 120/80&nbsp;<abbr title=\"millimeters of mercury\">mm Hg</abbr>.</p>\n<p>Blood pressure varies throughout the day, depending on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Body position</li>\n<li>Breathing rhythm</li>\n<li>Stress level</li>\n<li>Physical condition</li>\n<li>Medications you take</li>\n<li>What you eat and drink</li>\n<li>Time of day</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Blood pressure is usually lowest at night and rises sharply on waking.</p>\n<h3>Blood pressure: How low can you go?</h3>\n<p>What\'s considered low blood pressure for you may be normal for someone else. Most doctors consider blood pressure too low only if it causes symptoms.</p>\n<p>Some experts define low blood pressure as readings lower than 90&nbsp;<abbr title=\"millimeters of mercury\">mm Hg</abbr>&nbsp;systolic or 60&nbsp;<abbr title=\"millimeters of mercury\">mm Hg</abbr>&nbsp;diastolic. If either number is below that, your pressure is lower than normal.</p>\n<p>A sudden fall in blood pressure can be dangerous. A change of just 20&nbsp;<abbr title=\"millimeters of mercury\">mm Hg</abbr>&nbsp;&mdash; a drop from 110 systolic to 90&nbsp;<abbr title=\"millimeters of mercury\">mm Hg</abbr>&nbsp;systolic, for example &mdash; can cause dizziness and fainting when the brain fails to receive enough blood. And big drops, such as those caused by uncontrolled bleeding, severe infections or allergic reactions, can be life-threatening.</p>\n<h3>Conditions that can cause low blood pressure</h3>\n<p>Medical conditions that can cause low blood pressure include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pregnancy.</strong>&nbsp;Because the circulatory system expands rapidly during pregnancy, blood pressure is likely to drop. This is normal, and blood pressure usually returns to your pre-pregnancy level after you\'ve given birth.</li>\n<li><strong>Heart problems.</strong>&nbsp;Some heart conditions that can lead to low blood pressure include extremely low heart rate (bradycardia), heart valve problems, heart attack and heart failure.</li>\n<li><strong>Endocrine problems.</strong>&nbsp;Parathyroid disease, adrenal insufficiency (Addison\'s disease), low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and, in some cases, diabetes can trigger low blood pressure.</li>\n<li><strong>Dehydration.</strong>&nbsp;When your body loses more water than it takes in, it can cause weakness, dizziness and fatigue. Fever, vomiting, severe diarrhea, overuse of diuretics and strenuous exercise can lead to dehydration.</li>\n<li><strong>Blood loss.</strong>&nbsp;Losing a lot of blood, such as from a major injury or internal bleeding, reduces the amount of blood in your body, leading to a severe drop in blood pressure.</li>\n<li><strong>Severe infection (septicemia).</strong>&nbsp;When an infection in the body enters the bloodstream, it can lead to a life-threatening drop in blood pressure called septic shock.</li>\n<li><strong>Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis).</strong>&nbsp;Common triggers of this severe and potentially life-threatening reaction include foods, certain medications, insect venoms and latex. Anaphylaxis can cause breathing problems, hives, itching, a swollen throat and a dangerous drop in blood pressure.</li>\n<li><strong>Lack of nutrients in your diet.</strong>&nbsp;A lack of the vitamin B-12, folate and iron can keep your body from producing enough red blood cells (anemia), causing low blood pressure.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Medications that can cause low blood pressure</h3>\n<p>Some medications can cause low blood pressure, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Water pills (diuretics), such as furosemide (Lasix) and hydrochlorothiazide (Microzide, others)</li>\n<li>Alpha blockers, such as prazosin (Minipress)</li>\n<li>Beta blockers, such as atenolol (Tenormin) and propranolol (Inderal, Innopran XL, others)</li>\n<li>Drugs for Parkinson\'s disease, such as pramipexole (Mirapex) or those containing levodopa</li>\n<li>Certain types of antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants), including doxepin (Silenor) and imipramine (Tofranil)</li>\n<li>Drugs for erectile dysfunction, including sildenafil (Revatio, Viagra) or tadalafil (Adcirca, Alyq, Cialis), particularly when taken with the heart medication nitroglycerin (Nitrostat, others)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Types of low blood pressure</h3>\n<p>Doctors often break down low blood pressure (hypotension) into categories, depending on the causes and other factors. Some types of low blood pressure include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Low blood pressure on standing up (orthostatic or postural) hypotension).</strong>&nbsp;This is a sudden drop in blood pressure when you stand up from a sitting position or after lying down.</p>\n<p>Gravity causes blood to pool in your legs when you stand. Ordinarily, your body compensates by increasing your heart rate and constricting blood vessels, thereby ensuring that enough blood returns to your brain.</p>\n<p>But in people with orthostatic hypotension, this compensating mechanism fails and blood pressure falls, leading to dizziness, lightheadedness, blurred vision and even fainting.</p>\n<p>Orthostatic hypotension can occur for various reasons, including dehydration, prolonged bed rest, pregnancy, diabetes, heart problems, burns, excessive heat, large varicose veins and certain neurological disorders.</p>\n<p>A number of medications also can cause orthostatic hypotension, particularly drugs used to treat high blood pressure &mdash; diuretics, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors &mdash; as well as antidepressants and drugs used to treat Parkinson\'s disease and erectile dysfunction.</p>\n<p>Orthostatic hypotension is especially common in older adults, but it also affects young, otherwise healthy people who stand up suddenly after sitting with their legs crossed for long periods or after squatting for a time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Low blood pressure after eating (postprandial hypotension).</strong>&nbsp;This drop in blood pressure occurs one to two hours after eating and affects mostly older adults.</p>\n<p>Blood flows to your digestive tract after you eat. Ordinarily, your body increases your heart rate and constricts certain blood vessels to help maintain normal blood pressure. But in some people these mechanisms fail, leading to dizziness, faintness and falls.</p>\n<p>Postprandial hypotension is more likely to affect people with high blood pressure or autonomic nervous system disorders such as Parkinson\'s disease.</p>\n<p>Eating small, low-carbohydrate meals; drinking more water; and avoiding alcohol might help reduce symptoms.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Low blood pressure from faulty brain signals (neurally mediated hypotension).</strong>&nbsp;This disorder, which causes a blood pressure drop after standing for long periods, mostly affects young adults and children. It seems to occur because of a miscommunication between the heart and the brain.</li>\n<li><strong>Low blood pressure due to nervous system damage (multiple system atrophy with orthostatic hypotension).</strong>&nbsp;Also called Shy-Drager syndrome, this rare disorder has many Parkinson disease-like symptoms. It causes progressive damage to the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary functions such as blood pressure, heart rate, breathing and digestion. It\'s associated with having very high blood pressure while lying down.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Risk factors</h2>\n<p>Low blood pressure (hypotension) can occur in anyone, though certain types of low blood pressure are more common depending on your age or other factors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Age.</strong>&nbsp;Drops in blood pressure on standing or after eating occur primarily in adults older than 65. Neurally mediated hypotension primarily affects children and younger adults.</li>\n<li><strong>Medications.</strong>&nbsp;People who take certain medications, for example, high blood pressure medications such as alpha blockers, have a greater risk of low blood pressure.</li>\n<li><strong>Certain diseases.</strong>&nbsp;Parkinson\'s disease, diabetes and some heart conditions put you at a greater risk of developing low blood pressure.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Complications</h2>\n<p>Even moderate forms of low blood pressure can cause dizziness, weakness, fainting and a risk of injury from falls.</p>\n<p>And severely low blood pressure can deprive your body of enough oxygen to carry out its functions, leading to damage to your heart and brain.</p>\n<h2>Treatment</h2>\n<p>Low blood pressure that either doesn\'t cause signs or symptoms or causes only mild symptoms rarely requires treatment.</p>\n<p>If you have symptoms, treatment depends on the cause. For instance, when medication causes low blood pressure, treatment usually involves changing or stopping the medication or lowering the dose.</p>\n<p>If it\'s not clear what\'s causing low blood pressure or no treatment exists, the goal is to raise your blood pressure and reduce signs and symptoms. Depending on your age, health and the type of low blood pressure you have, you can do this in several ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Use more salt.</strong>&nbsp;Experts usually recommend limiting salt in your diet because sodium can raise blood pressure, sometimes dramatically. For people with low blood pressure, that can be a good thing.</p>\n<p>But because excess sodium can lead to heart failure, especially in older adults, it\'s important to check with your doctor before increasing the salt in your diet.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Drink more water.</strong>&nbsp;Fluids increase blood volume and help prevent dehydration, both of which are important in treating hypotension.</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Wear compression stockings.</strong>&nbsp;The elastic stockings commonly used to relieve the pain and swelling of varicose veins can help reduce the pooling of blood in your legs.</p>\n<p>Some people tolerate elastic abdominal binders better than they do compression stockings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Medications.</strong>&nbsp;Several medications can be used to treat low blood pressure that occurs when you stand up (orthostatic hypotension). For example, the drug fludrocortisone, which boosts your blood volume, is often used to treat this form of low blood pressure.</p>\n<p>Doctors often use the drug midodrine (Orvaten) to raise standing blood pressure levels in people with chronic orthostatic hypotension. It works by restricting the ability of your blood vessels to expand, which raises blood pressure.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Lifestyle and home remedies</h2>\n<p>Depending on the reason for your low blood pressure, you might be able to reduce or prevent symptoms.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Drink more water, less alcohol.</strong>&nbsp;Alcohol is dehydrating and can lower blood pressure, even if you drink in moderation. Water, on the other hand, fights dehydration and increases blood volume.</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Pay attention to your body positions.</strong>&nbsp;Gently move from a prone or squatting to a standing position. Don\'t sit with your legs crossed.</p>\n<p>If you begin to get symptoms while standing, cross your thighs in a scissors fashion and squeeze, or put one foot on a ledge or chair and lean as far forward as possible. These moves encourage blood flow from your legs to your heart.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Eat small, low-carb meals.</strong>&nbsp;To help prevent blood pressure from dropping sharply after meals, eat small portions several times a day and limit high-carbohydrate foods such as potatoes, rice, pasta and bread.</p>\n<p>Your doctor also might recommend drinking one or two strong cups of caffeinated coffee or tea with breakfast. Don\'t drink caffeine throughout the day because you will become less sensitive to caffeine, and caffeine can cause dehydration.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Exercise regularly.</strong>&nbsp;Aim for 30 to 60 minutes a day of exercise that raises your heart rate and resistance exercises two or three days a week. Avoid exercising in hot, humid conditions.</li>\n</ul>','Low blood pressure (hypotension)','2023-07-09 11:05:43','2023-07-09 11:05:43',NULL),(11,10,NULL,'High blood pressure (hypertension)','<h1><a>High blood pressure (hypertension)</a></h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>High blood pressure is a common condition in which the long-term force of the blood against your artery walls is high enough that it may eventually cause health problems, such as heart disease.</p>\n<p>Blood pressure is determined both by the amount of blood your heart pumps and the amount of resistance to blood flow in your arteries. The more blood your heart pumps and the narrower your arteries, the higher your blood pressure.</p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<p>You can have high blood pressure (hypertension) for years without any symptoms. Even without symptoms, damage to blood vessels and your heart continues and can be detected. Uncontrolled high blood pressure increases your risk of serious health problems, including heart attack and stroke.</p>\n<p>High blood pressure generally develops over many years, and it affects nearly everyone eventually. Fortunately, high blood pressure can be easily detected. And once you know you have high blood pressure, you can work with your doctor to control it.</p>\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\n<p>Most people with high blood pressure have no signs or symptoms, even if blood pressure readings reach dangerously high levels.</p>\n<p>A few people with high blood pressure may have headaches, shortness of breath or nosebleeds, but these signs and symptoms aren\'t specific and usually don\'t occur until high blood pressure has reached a severe or life-threatening stage.</p>\n<h3>When to see a doctor</h3>\n<p>You\'ll likely have your blood pressure taken as part of a routine doctor\'s appointment.</p>\n<p>Ask your doctor for a blood pressure reading at least every two years starting at age 18. If you\'re age 40 or older, or you\'re 18 to 39 with a high risk of high blood pressure, ask your doctor for a blood pressure reading every year.</p>\n<p>Blood pressure generally should be checked in both arms to determine if there\'s a difference. It\'s important to use an appropriate-sized arm cuff.</p>\n<p>Your doctor will likely recommend more frequent readings if you\'ve already been diagnosed with high blood pressure or have other risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Children age 3 and older will usually have blood pressure measured as a part of their yearly checkups.</p>\n<p>If you don\'t regularly see your doctor, you may be able to get a free blood pressure screening at a health resource fair or other locations in your community. You can also find machines in some stores that will measure your blood pressure for free.</p>\n<p>Public blood pressure machines, such as those found in pharmacies, may provide helpful information about your blood pressure, but they may have some limitations. The accuracy of these machines depends on several factors, such as a correct cuff size and proper use of the machines. Ask your doctor for advice on using public blood pressure machines.</p>\n<h2>Causes</h2>\n<p>There are two types of high blood pressure.</p>\n<h3>Primary (essential) hypertension</h3>\n<p>For most adults, there\'s no identifiable cause of high blood pressure. This type of high blood pressure, called primary (essential) hypertension, tends to develop gradually over many years.</p>\n<h3>Secondary hypertension</h3>\n<p>Some people have high blood pressure caused by an underlying condition. This type of high blood pressure, called secondary hypertension, tends to appear suddenly and cause higher blood pressure than does primary hypertension. Various conditions and medications can lead to secondary hypertension, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Obstructive sleep apnea</li>\n<li>Kidney problems</li>\n<li>Adrenal gland tumors</li>\n<li>Thyroid problems</li>\n<li>Certain defects you\'re born with (congenital) in blood vessels</li>\n<li>Certain medications, such as birth control pills, cold remedies, decongestants, over-the-counter pain relievers and some prescription drugs</li>\n<li>Illegal drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Risk factors</h2>\n<p>High blood pressure has many risk factors, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Age.</strong>&nbsp;The risk of high blood pressure increases as you age. Until about age 64, high blood pressure is more common in men. Women are more likely to develop high blood pressure after age 65.</li>\n<li><strong>Race.</strong>&nbsp;High blood pressure is particularly common among people of African heritage, often developing at an earlier age than it does in whites. Serious complications, such as stroke, heart attack and kidney failure, also are more common in people of African heritage.</li>\n<li><strong>Family history.</strong>&nbsp;High blood pressure tends to run in families.</li>\n<li><strong>Being overweight or obese.</strong>&nbsp;The more you weigh the more blood you need to supply oxygen and nutrients to your tissues. As the volume of blood circulated through your blood vessels increases, so does the pressure on your artery walls.</li>\n<li><strong>Not being physically active.</strong>&nbsp;People who are inactive tend to have higher heart rates. The higher your heart rate, the harder your heart must work with each contraction and the stronger the force on your arteries. Lack of physical activity also increases the risk of being overweight.</li>\n<li><strong>Using tobacco.</strong>&nbsp;Not only does smoking or chewing tobacco immediately raise your blood pressure temporarily, but the chemicals in tobacco can damage the lining of your artery walls. This can cause your arteries to narrow and increase your risk of heart disease. Secondhand smoke also can increase your heart disease risk.</li>\n<li><strong>Too much salt (sodium) in your diet.</strong>&nbsp;Too much sodium in your diet can cause your body to retain fluid, which increases blood pressure.</li>\n<li><strong>Too little potassium in your diet.</strong>&nbsp;Potassium helps balance the amount of sodium in your cells. If you don\'t get enough potassium in your diet or retain enough potassium, you may accumulate too much sodium in your blood.</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Drinking too much alcohol.</strong>&nbsp;Over time, heavy drinking can damage your heart. Having more than one drink a day for women and more than two drinks a day for men may affect your blood pressure.</p>\n<p>If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and two drinks a day for men. One drink equals 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine or 1.5 ounces of 80-proof liquor.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Stress.</strong>&nbsp;High levels of stress can lead to a temporary increase in blood pressure. If you try to relax by eating more, using tobacco or drinking alcohol, you may only increase problems with high blood pressure.</li>\n<li><strong>Certain chronic conditions.</strong>&nbsp;Certain chronic conditions also may increase your risk of high blood pressure, such as kidney disease, diabetes and sleep apnea.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sometimes pregnancy contributes to high blood pressure, as well.</p>\n<p>Although high blood pressure is most common in adults, children may be at risk, too. For some children, high blood pressure is caused by problems with the kidneys or heart. But for a growing number of kids, poor lifestyle habits, such as an unhealthy diet, obesity and lack of exercise, contribute to high blood pressure.</p>\n<h2>Complications</h2>\n<p>The excessive pressure on your artery walls caused by high blood pressure can damage your blood vessels, as well as organs in your body. The higher your blood pressure and the longer it goes uncontrolled, the greater the damage.</p>\n<p>Uncontrolled high blood pressure can lead to complications including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Heart attack or stroke.</strong>&nbsp;High blood pressure can cause hardening and thickening of the arteries (atherosclerosis), which can lead to a heart attack, stroke or other complications.</li>\n<li><strong>Aneurysm.</strong>&nbsp;Increased blood pressure can cause your blood vessels to weaken and bulge, forming an aneurysm. If an aneurysm ruptures, it can be life-threatening.</li>\n<li><strong>Heart failure.</strong>&nbsp;To pump blood against the higher pressure in your vessels, the heart has to work harder. This causes the walls of the heart\'s pumping chamber to thicken (left ventricular hypertrophy). Eventually, the thickened muscle may have a hard time pumping enough blood to meet your body\'s needs, which can lead to heart failure.</li>\n<li><strong>Weakened and narrowed blood vessels in your kidneys.</strong>&nbsp;This can prevent these organs from functioning normally.</li>\n<li><strong>Thickened, narrowed or torn blood vessels in the eyes.</strong>&nbsp;This can result in vision loss.</li>\n<li><strong>Metabolic syndrome.</strong>&nbsp;This syndrome is a cluster of disorders of your body\'s metabolism, including increased waist circumference; high triglycerides; low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the \"good\" cholesterol; high blood pressure and high insulin levels. These conditions make you more likely to develop diabetes, heart disease and stroke.</li>\n<li><strong>Trouble with memory or understanding.</strong>&nbsp;Uncontrolled high blood pressure may also affect your ability to think, remember and learn. Trouble with memory or understanding concepts is more common in people with high blood pressure.</li>\n<li><strong>Dementia.</strong>&nbsp;Narrowed or blocked arteries can limit blood flow to the brain, leading to a certain type of dementia (vascular dementia). A stroke that interrupts blood flow to the brain also can cause vascular dementia.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"css-0\">\n<div><a name=\"treating-hypertension\"></a>Treatment options for high blood pressure</div>\n<p>A number of factors help your doctor determine the best treatment option for you. These factors include which type of hypertension you have and what causes have been identified.</p>\n<h3>Primary hypertension treatment options</h3>\n<p>If your doctor diagnoses you with primary hypertension, lifestyle changes may help reduce your high blood pressure. If lifestyle changes alone aren&rsquo;t enough, or if they stop being effective, your doctor may prescribe medication.</p>\n<h3>Secondary hypertension treatment options</h3>\n<p>If your doctor discovers an underlying issue causing your hypertension, treatment will focus on that other condition. For example, if a medicine you&rsquo;ve started taking is causing increased blood pressure, your doctor will try other medicines that don&rsquo;t have this side effect.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, hypertension is persistent despite treatment for the underlying cause. In this case, your doctor may work with you to develop lifestyle changes and prescribe medications to help reduce your blood pressure.</p>\n<p>Treatment plans for hypertension often evolve. What worked at first may become less useful over time. Your doctor will continue to work with you to refine your treatment.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>Medication for high blood pressure</div>\n<p>Many people go through a trial-and-error phase with blood pressure medications. You may need to try different medicines until you find one or a combination of medications that work for you.</p>\n<p>Some of the medications used to treat hypertension include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Beta-blockers</strong>:&nbsp;<a>Beta-blockers</a>&nbsp;make your heart beat slower and with less force. This reduces the amount of blood pumped through your arteries with each beat, which lowers blood pressure. It also blocks certain hormones in your body that can raise your blood pressure.</li>\n<li><strong>Diuretics</strong>: High sodium levels and excess fluid in your body can increase blood pressure.&nbsp;<a>Diuretics</a>, also called water pills, help your kidneys remove excess sodium from your body. As the sodium leaves, extra fluid in your bloodstream moves into your urine, which helps lower your blood pressure.</li>\n<li><strong>ACE inhibitors</strong>: Angiotensin is a chemical that causes blood vessels and artery walls to tighten and narrow.&nbsp;<a>ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitors</a>&nbsp;prevent the body from producing as much of this chemical. This helps blood vessels relax and reduces blood pressure.</li>\n<li><strong>Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)</strong>: While ACE inhibitors aim to stop the creation of angiotensin,&nbsp;<a>ARBs</a>&nbsp;block angiotensin from binding with receptors. Without the chemical, blood vessels won&rsquo;t tighten. That helps relax vessels and lower blood pressure.</li>\n<li><strong>Calcium channel blockers:</strong>&nbsp;<a>These medications</a>&nbsp;block some of the calcium from entering the cardiac muscles of your heart. This leads to less forceful heartbeats and a lower blood pressure. These medicines also work in the blood vessels, causing them to relax and further lowering blood pressure.</li>\n<li><strong>Alpha-2 agonists:</strong>&nbsp;This type of medication changes the nerve impulses that cause blood vessels to tighten. This helps blood vessels to relax, which reduces blood pressure.</li>\n</ul>\n<div><a name=\"home-remedies-for-hypertension\"></a>Home remedies for high blood pressure</div>\n<p>Healthy lifestyle changes can help you control the factors that cause hypertension. Here are some of the most common home remedies.</p>\n<h3>Developing a healthy diet</h3>\n<p>A heart-healthy diet is vital for helping to reduce high blood pressure. It&rsquo;s also important for managing hypertension that is under control and reducing the risk of complications. These complications include heart disease, stroke, and heart attack.</p>\n<p>A heart-healthy diet emphasizes foods that include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>fruits</li>\n<li>vegetables</li>\n<li>whole grains</li>\n<li>lean proteins like fish</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Increasing physical activity</h3>\n<p>Reaching a healthy weight should include being more physically active. In addition to helping you shed pounds, exercise can help reduce stress, lower blood pressure naturally, and strengthen your cardiovascular system.</p>\n<p>Aim to get 150 minutes of moderate physical activity each week. That&rsquo;s about 30 minutes five times per week.</p>\n<h3>Reaching a healthy weight</h3>\n<p>If you are overweight or obese, losing weight through a heart-healthy diet and increased physical activity can help lower your blood pressure.</p>\n<h3>Managing stress</h3>\n<p>Exercise is a great way to manage stress. Other activities can also be helpful. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>meditation</li>\n<li>deep breathing</li>\n<li>massage</li>\n<li>muscle relaxation</li>\n<li>yoga or tai chi</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are all proven stress-reducing techniques. Getting adequate sleep can also help reduce stress levels.</p>\n<h3>Adopting a cleaner lifestyle</h3>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re a smoker, try to quit. The chemicals in tobacco smoke damage the body&rsquo;s tissues and harden blood vessel walls.</p>\n<p>If you regularly consume too much alcohol or have an alcohol dependency, seek help to reduce the amount you drink or stop altogether.

Some claim the key is to eat less and exercise more, others that low fat is the only way to go, while others prescribe cutting out carbs. So, what should you believe?</p>\n<p>The truth is there is no &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; solution to permanent healthy weight loss. What works for one person may not work for you, since our bodies respond differently to different foods, depending on genetics and other health factors. To find the method of weight loss that&rsquo;s right for you will likely take time and require patience, commitment, and some experimentation with different foods and diets.</p>\n<p>While some people respond well to counting calories or similar restrictive methods, others respond better to having more freedom in planning their weight-loss programs. Being free to simply avoid fried foods or cut back on refined carbs can set them up for success. So, don&rsquo;t get too discouraged if a diet that worked for somebody else doesn&rsquo;t work for you. And don&rsquo;t beat yourself up if a diet proves too restrictive for you to stick with. Ultimately, a diet is only right for you if it&rsquo;s one you can stick with over time.</p>\n<p>Remember: while there&rsquo;s no easy fix to losing weight, there are plenty of steps you can take to develop a healthier relationship with food, curb emotional triggers to overeating, and achieve a healthy weight.</p>\n<h2>Four popular weight loss strategies</h2>\n<h3>1. Cut calories</h3>\n<p>Some experts believe that successfully managing your weight comes down to a simple equation: If you eat fewer calories than you burn, you lose weight. Sounds easy, right? Then why is losing weight so hard?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Weight loss isn&rsquo;t a linear event over time.</strong>&nbsp;When you cut calories, you may drop weight for the first few weeks, for example, and then something changes. You eat the same number of calories but you lose less weight or no weight at all. That&rsquo;s because when you lose weight you&rsquo;re losing water and lean tissue as well as fat, your metabolism slows, and your body changes in other ways. So, in order to continue dropping weight each week, you need to continue cutting calories.</li>\n<li><strong>A calorie isn&rsquo;t always a calorie.</strong>&nbsp;Eating 100 calories of high fructose corn syrup, for example, can have a different effect on your body than eating 100 calories of broccoli. The trick for sustained weight loss is to ditch the foods that are packed with calories but don&rsquo;t make you feel full (like candy) and replace them with foods that fill you up without being loaded with calories (like vegetables).</li>\n<li><strong>Many of us don&rsquo;t always eat simply to satisfy hunger.</strong>&nbsp;We also turn to food for comfort or to relieve stress&mdash;which can quickly derail any weight loss plan.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Cut carbs</h3>\n<p>A different way of viewing weight loss identifies the problem as not one of consuming too many calories, but rather the way the body accumulates fat after consuming carbohydrates&mdash;in particular the role of the hormone insulin. When you eat a meal, carbohydrates from the food enter your bloodstream as glucose. In order to keep your blood sugar levels in check, your body always burns off this glucose before it burns off fat from a meal.</p>\n<p>If you eat a carbohydrate-rich meal (lots of pasta, rice, bread, or French fries, for example), your body releases insulin to help with the influx of all this glucose into your blood. As well as regulating blood sugar levels, insulin does two things: It prevents your fat cells from releasing fat for the body to burn as fuel (because its priority is to burn off the glucose) and it creates more fat cells for storing everything that your body can&rsquo;t burn off. The result is that you gain weight and your body now requires more fuel to burn, so you eat more. Since insulin only burns carbohydrates, you crave carbs and so begins a vicious cycle of consuming carbs and gaining weight. To lose weight, the reasoning goes, you need to break this cycle&nbsp;<a>by reducing carbs</a>.</p>\n<p>Most low-carb diets advocate replacing carbs with protein and fat, which could have some negative long-term effects on your health. If you do try a low-carb diet, you can reduce your risks and limit your intake of saturated and trans fats by choosing lean meats, fish and vegetarian sources of protein, low-fat dairy products, and eating plenty of leafy green and non-starchy vegetables.</p>\n<h3>3. Cut fat</h3>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a mainstay of many diets: if you don&rsquo;t want to get fat, don&rsquo;t eat fat. Walk down any grocery store aisle and you&rsquo;ll be bombarded with reduced-fat snacks, dairy, and packaged meals. But while our low-fat options have exploded, so have obesity rates. So, why haven&rsquo;t low-fat diets worked for more of us?</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Not all fat is bad.</strong>&nbsp;Healthy or&nbsp;<a>&ldquo;good&rdquo; fats</a>&nbsp;can actually help to control your weight, as well as manage your moods and fight fatigue. Unsaturated fats found in avocados, nuts, seeds, soy milk, tofu, and fatty fish can help fill you up, while adding a little tasty olive oil to a plate of vegetables, for example, can make it easier to eat healthy food and improve the overall quality of your diet.</li>\n<li><strong>We often make the wrong trade-offs.</strong>&nbsp;Many of us make the mistake of swapping fat for the empty calories of sugar and refined carbohydrates. Instead of eating whole-fat yoghurt, for example, we eat low- or no-fat versions that are packed with sugar to make up for the loss of taste. Or we swap our fatty breakfast bacon for a muffin or donut that causes rapid spikes in blood sugar.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>4. Follow the Mediterranean diet</h3>\n<p>The&nbsp;<a>Mediterranean diet</a>&nbsp;emphasizes eating good fats and good carbs along with large quantities of fresh fruits and vegetables, nuts, fish, and olive oil&mdash;and only modest amounts of meat and cheese. The Mediterranean diet is more than just about food, though. Regular physical activity and sharing meals with others are also major components.</p>\n<p>Whatever weight loss strategy you try, it&rsquo;s important to stay motivated and avoid common dieting pitfalls, such as emotional eating.</p>\n<h2>Control emotional eating</h2>\n<p>We don&rsquo;t always eat simply to satisfy hunger. All too often, we turn to food when we&rsquo;re stressed or anxious, which can wreck any diet and pack on the pounds. Do you eat when you&rsquo;re worried, bored, or lonely? Do you snack in front of the TV at the end of a stressful day? Recognizing your&nbsp;<a>emotional eating</a>&nbsp;triggers can make all the difference in your weight-loss efforts. If you eat when you&rsquo;re:</p>\n<p><strong>Stressed&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; find healthier ways to calm yourself. Try yoga, meditation, or soaking in a hot bath.</p>\n<p><strong>Low on energy&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; find other mid-afternoon pick-me-ups. Try walking around the block, listening to energizing music, or taking a short nap.</p>\n<p><strong>Lonely or bored&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; reach out to others instead of reaching for the refrigerator. Call a friend who makes you laugh, take your dog for a walk, or go to the library, mall, or park&mdash;anywhere there&rsquo;s people.</p>\n<h3>Practice mindful eating instead</h3>\n<p><strong>Avoid distractions while eating.</strong>&nbsp;Try not to eat while working, watching TV, or driving. It&rsquo;s too easy to mindlessly overeat.</p>\n<p><strong>Pay attention.</strong>&nbsp;<a>Eat slowly</a>, savoring the smells and textures of your food. If your mind wanders, gently return your attention to your food and how it tastes.</p>\n<p><strong>Mix things up</strong>&nbsp;to focus on the experience of eating. Try using chopsticks rather than a fork, or use your utensils with your non-dominant hand.</p>\n<p><strong>Stop eating before you are full.</strong>&nbsp;It takes time for the signal to reach your brain that you&rsquo;ve had enough. Don&rsquo;t feel obligated to always clean your plate.</p>\n<h2>Stay motivated</h2>\n<p>Permanent weight loss requires making healthy changes to your lifestyle and food choices. To stay motivated:</p>\n<p><strong>Find a cheering section.</strong>&nbsp;Social support means a lot. Programs like Jenny Craig and Weight Watchers use group support to impact weight loss and lifelong healthy eating. Seek out support&mdash;whether in the form of family, friends, or a support group&mdash;to get the encouragement you need.</p>\n<p><strong>Slow and steady wins the race.</strong>&nbsp;Losing weight too fast can take a toll on your mind and body, making you feel sluggish, drained, and sick. Aim to lose one to two pounds a week so you&rsquo;re losing fat rather than water and muscle.</p>\n<p><strong>Set goals to keep you motivated.</strong>&nbsp;Short-term goals, like wanting to fit into a bikini for the summer, usually don&rsquo;t work as well as wanting to feel more confident or become healthier for your children&rsquo;s sakes. When temptation strikes, focus on the benefits you&rsquo;ll reap from being healthier.</p>\n<p><strong>Use tools to track your progress.&nbsp;</strong>Smartphone apps, fitness trackers, or simply keeping a journal can help you keep track of the food you eat, the calories you burn, and the weight you lose. Seeing the results in black and white can help you stay motivated.</p>\n<p><strong>Get plenty of sleep.</strong>&nbsp;Lack of sleep stimulates your appetite so you want more food than normal; at the same time, it stops you feeling satisfied, making you want to keep eating. Sleep deprivation can also affect your motivation, so aim for eight hours of&nbsp;<a>quality sleep a night</a>.</p>\n<h2>Cut down on sugar and refined carbs</h2>\n<p>Whether or not you&rsquo;re specifically aiming to cut carbs, most of us consume unhealthy amounts of&nbsp;<a >sugar and refined carbohydrates</a>&nbsp;such as white bread, pizza dough, pasta, pastries, white flour, white rice, and sweetened breakfast cereals. Replacing refined carbs with their whole-grain counterparts and eliminating candy and desserts is only part of the solution, though. Sugar is hidden in foods as diverse as canned soups and vegetables, pasta sauce, margarine, and many reduced fat foods. Since your body gets all it needs from sugar naturally occurring in food, all this added sugar amounts to nothing but a lot of empty calories and unhealthy spikes in your blood glucose.</p>\n<article>\n<h2>Fill up with fruit, veggies, and fiber</h2>\n<p>Even if you&rsquo;re cutting calories, that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean you have to eat less food.&nbsp;<a >High-fiber foods</a>&nbsp;such as fruit, vegetables, beans, and whole grains are higher in volume and take longer to digest, making them filling&mdash;and great for weight-loss.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s generally okay to eat as much fresh fruit and non-starchy vegetables as you want&mdash;you&rsquo;ll feel full before you&rsquo;ve overdone it on the calories.</p>\n<p><strong>Eat vegetables raw or steamed</strong>, not fried or breaded, and dress them with herbs and spices or a little olive oil for flavor.</p>\n<p><strong>Add fruit to low sugar cereal</strong>&mdash;blueberries, strawberries, sliced bananas. You&rsquo;ll still enjoy lots of sweetness, but with fewer calories, less sugar, and more fiber.</p>\n<p><strong>Bulk out sandwiches</strong>&nbsp;by adding healthy veggie choices like lettuce, tomatoes, sprouts, cucumbers, and avocado.</p>\n<p><strong>Snack on carrots or celery with hummus</strong>&nbsp;instead of a high-calorie chips and dip.</p>\n<p><strong>Add more veggies to your favorite main courses</strong>&nbsp;to make your dish more substantial. Even pasta and stir-fries can be diet-friendly if you use less noodles and more vegetables.</p>\n<p><strong>Start your meal with salad or vegetable soup</strong>&nbsp;to help fill you up so you eat less of your entr&eacute;e.</p>\n<h2>Take charge of your food environment</h2>\n<p>Set yourself up for weight-loss success by taking charge of your food environment: when you eat, how much you eat, and what foods you make easily available.</p>\n<p><strong>Cook your own meals at home.</strong>&nbsp;This allows you to control both portion size and what goes in to the food. Restaurant and packaged foods generally contain a lot more sugar, unhealthy fat, and calories than&nbsp;<a >food cooked at home</a>&mdash;plus the portion sizes tend to be larger.</p>\n<p><strong>Serve yourself smaller portions.</strong>&nbsp;Use small plates, bowls, and cups to make your portions appear larger. Don&rsquo;t eat out of large bowls or directly from food containers, which makes it difficult to assess how much you&rsquo;ve eaten.</p>\n<p><strong>Eat early.</strong>&nbsp;Studies suggest that consuming more of your daily calories at breakfast and fewer at dinner can help you drop more pounds. Eating a larger, healthy breakfast can jump-start your metabolism, stop you feeling hungry during the day, and give you more time to burn off the calories.</p>\n<p><strong>Fast for 14 hours a day.</strong>&nbsp;Try to eat dinner earlier in the day and then fast until breakfast the next morning. Eating only when you&rsquo;re most active and giving your digestion a long break may aid weight loss.</p>\n<p><strong>Plan your meals and snacks ahead of time.</strong>&nbsp;You can create your own small portion snacks in plastic bags or containers. Eating on a schedule will help you avoid eating when you aren&rsquo;t truly hungry.</p>\n<p><strong>Drink more water.</strong>&nbsp;Thirst can often be confused with hunger, so by drinking water you can avoid extra calories.</p>\n<p><strong>Limit the amount of tempting foods you have at home.</strong>&nbsp;If you share a kitchen with non-dieters, store indulgent foods out of sight.</p>\n<h2>Get moving</h2>\n<p>The degree to which exercise aids weight loss is open to debate, but the benefits go way beyond burning calories.&nbsp;<a >Exercise</a>&nbsp;can increase your metabolism and improve your outlook&mdash;and it&rsquo;s something you can benefit from right now. Go for a walk, stretch, move around and you&rsquo;ll have more energy and motivation to tackle the other steps in your weight-loss program.</p>\n<p><strong>Lack time for a long workout?</strong>&nbsp;Three 10-minute spurts of exercise per day can be just as good as one 30-minute workout.</p>\n<p><strong>Remember: anything is better than nothing.</strong>&nbsp;Start off slowly with small amounts of physical activity each day. Then, as you start to lose weight and have more energy, you&rsquo;ll find it easier to become more physically active.</p>\n<p><strong>Find exercise you enjoy.</strong>&nbsp;Try walking with a friend, dancing, hiking, cycling, playing Frisbee with a dog, enjoying a pickup game of basketball, or playing activity-based video games with your kids.</p>\n<h2>Keeping the weight off</h2>\n<p>You may have heard the widely quoted statistic that 95% of people who lose weight on a diet will regain it within a few years&mdash;or even months. While there isn&rsquo;t much hard evidence to support that claim, it is true that many weight-loss plans fail in the long term. Often that&rsquo;s simply because diets that are too restrictive are very hard to maintain over time. However, that doesn&rsquo;t mean your weight loss attempts are doomed to failure. Far from it.</p>\n<p>Since it was established in 1994, The National Weight Control Registry (NWCR) in the United States, has tracked over<strong>&nbsp;</strong>10,000 individuals who have lost significant amounts of weight and kept it off for long periods of time.&nbsp;The study has found that participants who&rsquo;ve been successful in maintaining their weight loss share some common strategies. Whatever diet you use to lose weight in the first place, adopting these habits may help you to&nbsp;<em>keep</em>&nbsp;it off:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stay physically active</strong>. Successful dieters in the NWCR study exercise for about 60 minutes, typically walking.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep a food log</strong>. Recording what you eat every day helps to keep you accountable and motivated.</li>\n<li><strong>Eat breakfast every day.&nbsp;</strong>Most commonly in the study, it&rsquo;s cereal and fruit. Eating breakfast boosts metabolism and staves off hunger later in the day.</li>\n<li><strong>Eat more fiber and less unhealthy fat&nbsp;</strong>than the typical American diet.</li>\n<li><strong>Regularly check the scale</strong>. Weighing yourself weekly may help you to detect any small gains in weight, enabling you to promptly take corrective action before the problem escalates.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch less television</strong>. Cutting back on the time spent sitting in front of a screen can be a key part of adopting a more active lifestyle and preventing weight gain.</li>\n</ul>\n</article>\n<p >Authors: Melinda Smith, M.A., Jeanne Segal, Ph.D., and Lawrence Robinson</p>\n<div>\n<h4><a>Will you help keep HelpGuide free for all?</a></h4>\n<p>One in four people will struggle with mental health at some point in their lives.

Start with a hearty breakfast and have an extra slice or two of whole-grain toast with&nbsp;peanut butter. Whole grains are important for their fiber and peanut butter is calorie-dense and high in fat and protein.</p>\n<p><strong>(2) Add Extra Cheese to an Omelet and Use an Extra Egg:</strong></p>\n<p>Omelets are usually made with two or three eggs, some cheese and a variety of added ingredients, so they\'re already&nbsp;energy-dense. Add extra calories by using a little more cheese and an extra egg in your omelet. But save room for some healthy veggies like spinach, peppers, and onions, or maybe some mushrooms and tomatoes.</p>\n<p><strong>(3) Slice an Apple and Serve With Nut Butter:</strong></p>\n<p>Most people don\'t get enough fruits and vegetables, and although most of them are lower in calories, you don\'t want to give them up. So boost your snack-time calories by slathering some almond, peanut or cashew butter on apple slices. The flavor is fantastic, and you\'ll get lots of nutrients along with your calories.</p>\n<p><strong>(4)&nbsp;Add Cheese Sauces to Green Veggies:</strong></p>\n<p>Your mom told you to eat your veggies, and she was totally right. Green and colorful vegetables are chock full of vitamins, minerals, and fiber. But, they\'re also low in calories. Enhance your energy intake by adding cheese or cheese sauce&nbsp;to your favorite green veggies.</p>\n<p><strong>(5)&nbsp;Add Chopped Nuts, Oats, Fruit and Honey to Yogurt:</strong></p>\n<p>Here\'s one of our favorite ideas. Start with a smooth creamy Greek yogurt and add a generous portion of walnuts, almonds or pecans, plus oats and your favorite dried fruit. Top it off with a spoonful of honey, and you have the most delicious and healthful snack or dessert.</p>\n<p><strong>(6)&nbsp;Choose Creamed Soups Over Clear Soups:</strong></p>\n<p>Creamed soups are higher in calories than clear broth-based soups. A big bowl of creamed soup and crusty warm bread can make an excellent&nbsp;<a>energy-dense</a>&nbsp;meal. Keep your creamed soups healthy by choosing a cream of broccoli, cream of mushroom or similar types of soup.</p>\n<p><strong>(7)&nbsp;Top Your Potatoes With Sour Cream:</strong></p>\n<p>Potatoes are on the starchy side, so they\'re a good source of calories. Amp up the calories by adding sour cream.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Potatoes get a bad rap because they\'re high in carbohydrates, but your body uses carbs for energy and potatoes are rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Sour cream adds a bit of calcium along with the additional calories. You can also add calories with cheese or gravy.</p>\n<p><strong>(8)&nbsp;Eat Larger Portions of Starchy Vegetables Like Potatoes and Sweet Corn:</strong></p>\n<p>Sweet corn and potatoes are both nutritious vegetables, and they\'re also on the starchy side, so they\'re also higher in calories than green veggies. So, while you don\'t want to give up on Brussels sprouts, broccoli, and kale, you can feel free to load up on potatoes and sweet corn. Sweet potatoes are good too.</p>\n<p><strong>(9)&nbsp;You Can Increase Your Protein Intake (and Calories) With Protein Bars:</strong></p>\n<p>Protein bars are similar to trail mix but a bit less messy. You can make your protein bars or purchase any number of bars in any grocery or convenience store. Check out the&nbsp;<a>Nutrition Facts label</a>&nbsp;to see how many calories you\'re getting per serving.</p>\n<p><strong>(10)&nbsp;Drink Whole Milk, 100-percent Fruit or Vegetable Juice:</strong></p>\n<p>You\'re going to need to drink some beverages throughout the day. Sugary sodas may be tempting, and while they\'re high in calories, they\'ve got nothing else nutrition-wise.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>When it comes to beverages, choose whole milk or fruit and vegetable juices to add to your daily dose of vitamins and minerals.</p>\n<p><strong>(11)&nbsp;Carry a Bag of Trail Mix for a Convenient Snack:</strong></p>\n<p>Trail mix is a mixture of nuts, seeds, cereal and dried fruit. You can buy trail mix in grocery stores or make your own. In fact, you can add a few more calories by adding chocolate chips. Keep your trail mix in a plastic bag or container and carry them with you, so you have something to nibble on throughout the day.</p>\n</div>\n</div>','11 Tips to Help You Gain Healthy Weight','2023-07-09 11:05:43','2023-07-09 11:05:43',NULL),(17,16,NULL,'How to make healthy food choices','<h1>How to make healthy food choices:</h1>\n<h2>This can help if:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>you want a balanced diet but you don&rsquo;t know where to start</li>\n<li>you know your diet isn&rsquo;t great and need motivation to change</li>\n<li>you\'re looking for a healthier lifestyle.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Why eat well?</h2>\n<p>We\'ve all heard it before, but it\'s true: eating well is really good for you. When you eat a well-balanced diet:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>your energy levels will be optimised</li>\n<li>you&rsquo;ll feel healthier and stronger</li>\n<li>your immune system will be tougher</li>\n<li>you&rsquo;ll think more clearly and handle stress better</li>\n<li>your chances of developing diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease will decrease.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>It&rsquo;s all about balance</h2>\n<p>A balanced diet is one where you eat a wide variety of mostly healthy foods in moderation. There&rsquo;s a big difference between eating well and becoming obsessive about calories, portion size and &lsquo;clean eating&rsquo;. Being healthy isn&rsquo;t just about the way you look or how much you weigh.</p>\n<p>No food is off-limits when you maintain a healthy diet &ndash; it&rsquo;s just a question of how often you eat it and how much of it you eat. So, don&rsquo;t overthink it, and definitely don&rsquo;t feel guilty if you eat a piece of cake or a cookie occasionally.</p>\n<h2>Three (important) foodie facts</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Drink water.</strong>&nbsp;Water constitutes up to 60% of the human body, so when you feel thirsty, your hands-down best choice is water. Treat soft drinks, energy drinks and even juices as an occasional treat.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Don&rsquo;t fear fats.</strong>&nbsp;Fats are part of a healthy diet. But not all fats are the same. Unsaturated fats, like those found in avocados, nuts and olive oil, should play an important part in your diet. Avoid saturated and trans-fats &ndash; found in butter, fried food, pastries and cakes &ndash; as much as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Cut down on sugar.</strong>&nbsp;In 2015, the World Health Organization made a&nbsp;<a>strong recommendation</a>&nbsp;that adults reduce their sugar intake to less than 10% of their total daily calories. As a rough guide, this means fewer than ten teaspoons of sugar per day. Just one can of soft drink contains this amount of sugar, so you can see that you&rsquo;ve got to keep a close eye on the sweet stuff.</p>\n<h2>How to change your eating habits</h2>\n<p>If you want to change your eating habits, you&rsquo;ll need to have the right attitude. Here are a few tips on how to approach eating well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t try to change your eating habits completely right away. Make it a gradual process.</li>\n<li>Start with achievable goals, like having one piece of fruit every day, or adding salad or veggies to a meal.</li>\n<li>Experiment with various healthy foods and see which ones you like. The world&rsquo;s greatest chefs know that &lsquo;healthy&rsquo; food doesn&rsquo;t mean &lsquo;flavourless&rsquo; food.</li>\n<li>Allow yourself occasional treats.

Once you establish a routine of checking your blood pressure and have gained a better understanding of the numbers, you can begin checking it once or twice a day, at the same time each day.</p>\n<p>If it has already been determined that you have high blood pressure, it is important to measure your blood pressure at roughly the same times each day. This will provide consistent readings less affected by other factors, and therefore show how well your medication and dosage are working.Getting into the habit of checking your blood pressure in the morning and again before bed is generally the best practice. For the A.M. reading, don&rsquo;t take it immediately when you wake up; however, you should measure before breakfast or your morning coffee.</p>\n<h3><strong>What If I&rsquo;m Taking Medication? Does This Affect When I Should Check My Blood Pressure?</strong></h3>\n<p>Yes. If taking high blood pressure medication, your blood pressure measurements should coincide with your doses. The best time to check it is before you take your medication. It is at this point that the level of medication in your body will be at its lowest. This is known as a trough value. Measuring your blood pressure before you take the next dose will demonstrate how well the medication has been working.</p>\n<p>Another important variable to consider is symptoms. If you are experiencing a symptom of high blood pressure, it is a good idea to take a measurement then. Of course, if symptoms are severe, contact your doctor or seek immediate assistance.Common&nbsp;<a >symptoms</a>&nbsp;of high blood pressure include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Intense headaches</li>\n<li>Pounding in your chest, neck, or ears</li>\n<li>Irregular heartbeat</li>\n<li>Fatigue</li>\n<li>Vision problems</li>\n<li>Chest Pain</li>\n<li>Breathing issues</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Measuring your blood pressure while experiencing these symptoms can help determine if high blood pressure is the cause. It is also possible that your medication has lowered your blood pressure too much. A blood pressure reading during symptoms can also help determine if an adjustment to your medication is needed, either in dosage or time of day it is taken.</p>\n<h3><strong>What Else Is Important When Checking My Blood Pressure?</strong></h3>\n<p>Many factors can influence your blood pressure reading. The following guidelines will help you get the best and most accurate results from your blood pressure monitoring.</p>\n<p>Certain factors can increase your blood pressure. It is important to understand how these &ldquo;spikers&rdquo; affect your BP numbers. To learn their effect, check your BP before and after you experience each of the factors listed below. Once you know their effect, avoid these spikers before your daily checkup routine. This will prevent them from interrupting your baseline measurement and will allow you to see if your standard BP is stable. As you establish your BP routine, use the following guidelines to control spikes in your readings.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Caffeine &ndash; Hold off on the morning cup of coffee before measuring your blood pressure. No caffeine for half an hour before measuring is best.</li>\n<li>Tobacco &ndash; If you can stop altogether, your heart will thank you. Otherwise, avoid for at least half an hour before you take a measurement.</li>\n<li>Exercise &ndash; Great to do, just wait until after you check your blood pressure. Avoid exercise for thirty minutes prior to blood pressure readings.</li>\n<li>Medication &ndash; For an accurate reading, you should have as little medication in your blood as possible.</li>\n<li>Food &ndash; Wait to eat until after you check your blood pressure.</li>\n<li>Alcohol &ndash; Avoid alcohol consumption for at least half an hour before checking your blood pressure.</li>\n<li>Cold Temperatures &ndash; Your heart will be working hard to keep you warm in an arctic blast. Get to a comfortable temperature before measuring.</li>\n<li>Full Bladder - A full bladder can cause a rise in blood pressure. So, make a restroom stop before you measure.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Choose A Good Machine</strong></h4>\n<p>Myriad choices exist in today&rsquo;s marketplace for home blood pressure monitoring devices. Not all are equal. Be sure to choose an&nbsp;<a>FDA-approved device</a>. Once you have selected a machine, it not a bad idea to take it in to your doctor&rsquo;s office. Take your blood pressure reading in front of your physician, nurse or PA so they can ensure you are using it properly. Have them to take an additional reading on their machine, to compare for accuracy.</p>\n<p><strong>Take the Proper Position for Reliable Blood Pressure Readings</strong>Ensure you are&nbsp;<a >positioned correctly</a>&nbsp;for accurate blood pressure readings. Put your feet on the floor and straighten your back with arms supported at heart level. Make sure your elbow is at about the same level as your heart.</p>\n<p>Give yourself five minutes to rest quietly before slapping on the cuff. Because blood pressure can fluctuate, it&rsquo;s a good idea to take at least two readings each time. Always use the same arm, as readings can fluctuate from arm to arm. Track all of the results.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why Does My Blood Pressure Vary Throughout The Day?</strong></h3>\n<p>You may have heard the term circadian rhythm. If so, you know this is not a beat to keep on the dance floor. It is a biological cycle your body follows. As defined by the&nbsp;<a>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</a>, &ldquo;Circadian rhythms are physical, mental and behavioral changes that follow a roughly 24-hour cycle, responding primarily to light and darkness in an organism\'s environment.&rdquo; As your body cycles through this rhythm each day, responding to both internal and external stimuli, your blood pressure is affected.</p>\n<p>The study of these important rhythms, known as chronobiology, was founded by&nbsp;<a>Franz Halberg</a>. His&nbsp;<a>work</a>&nbsp;in this field has helped identify abnormal rhythms in day-night blood pressure readings.<strong>Keeping the Beat of Blood Pressure</strong>Following this chronobiological rhythm, your blood pressure is normally higher during the daytime and lower at night, during sleeping hours. Here&rsquo;s the problem. People with high blood pressure often don&rsquo;t experience this night time dip. This lack of a lowering of blood pressure at night is referred to as&nbsp;<a>non-dipping</a>.What&rsquo;s the big deal? Heart attack and stroke have been found to be associated with non-dipping. Your blood pressure stays elevated, and your body is not in the relaxed state it should be during rest.</p>\n<h3><strong>How Does My Circadian Rhythm Affect My Blood Pressure Medication?</strong></h3>\n<p>Michael Smolensky, adjunct professor of biomedical engineering at the University of Texas, Ausin,<a>&nbsp;reports</a>, &ldquo;\"The body doesn\'t respond to medications in the same way at different times of the day. Some drugs are not as effective or as well tolerated if they\'re taken at the wrong biological time. It\'s not that they\'re not effective at all, but they\'re certainly much less effective.\"Studies on chronotherapy (medication scheduling) have found that taking high blood pressure medications before bedtime help with the non-dipping issue. This reduces your risk of heart attack and stroke by normalizing your daily blood pressure rhythm. Specifically, it has been&nbsp;<a>reported</a>&nbsp;that drugs called ACE inhibitors and ARBs are the most effective when taken at bedtime.</p>\n<h2><strong>THE GIST</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Check your blood pressure 2x per day, morning and evening.</li>\n<li>If taking medication, align blood pressure readings with doses.</li>\n<li>Be aware of HBP symptoms, and take readings when they occur.</li>\n<li>Get the best readings by avoiding BP spikers, using a good machine, and testing properly.</li>\n<li>Realize your biological rhythms vary your blood pressure throughout the day.</li>\n<li>Apply chronobiology to decide when to take blood pressure medications.</li>\n<li>Use an easy-to-use app (<a>iOS</a>,&nbsp;<a>Android</a>) to track your daily blood pressure readings.</li>\n</ul>','WHY MEASURING BLOOD PRESSURE DAILY IS IMPORTANT','2023-07-09 11:05:43','2023-07-09 11:05:43',NULL),(19,18,NULL,'Get up and move:','<h2>Get up and move: benefits and tips for daily movement</h2>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n<p>Being active on a daily basis is one of the best things you can do for your health.

Find out when to test your blood sugar, how to use a blood sugar meter and more.</p>\n<p>If you have diabetes, self-testing your blood sugar (blood glucose) can be an important tool in managing your diabetes and preventing complications. You can test your blood sugar at home with a portable electronic device called a blood sugar meter using a small drop of your blood. You can also use a device called a continuous glucose monitor (CGM).</p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<h3>Why test your blood sugar</h3>\n<div class=\"auto\">&nbsp;</div>\n<p>Blood sugar testing provides useful information for diabetes management.

The frequency of testing usually depends on the type of diabetes you have and your treatment plan.</p>\n<h3>Type 1 diabetes</h3>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<p>Your doctor may recommend blood sugar testing four to 10 times a day if you have type 1 diabetes. You may need to test:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Before meals and snacks</li>\n<li>Before and after exercise</li>\n<li>Before bed</li>\n<li>During the night (sometimes)</li>\n<li>More often if you\'re ill</li>\n<li>More often if you change your daily routine</li>\n<li>More often if you start a new medication</li>\n</ul>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<h3>Type 2 diabetes</h3>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<p>If you take insulin to manage type 2 diabetes, your doctor may recommend blood sugar testing several times a day, depending on the type and amount of insulin you use. Testing is usually recommended before meals and at bedtime if you\'re taking multiple daily injections. You may need to test only before breakfast and dinner if you use just an intermediate- or a long-acting insulin.</p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<p>If you manage type 2 diabetes with noninsulin medications or with diet and exercise alone, you may not need to test your blood sugar daily.</p>\n<h3>What if you have a continuous glucose monitor (CGM)?</h3>\n<p>People with diabetes, particularly those with type 1 diabetes, may also choose to use CGMs. These devices measure your blood sugar every few minutes using a sensor inserted under the skin. These sensors are typically worn for a week or two before they need to be changed.</p>\n<p>The newest type of continuous glucose monitor has an implanted sensor that can detect blood sugar levels for up to three months. A transmitter worn on the body sends blood sugar information wirelessly from the sensor to a smartphone app.</p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<p>Some devices show your blood sugar reading at all times on a receiver, smartphone or smartwatch, and an alarm goes off if your blood sugar is going up or down too quickly. Others require that you check your blood sugar by running the receiver over the sensor periodically.</p>\n<p>Most of these devices still require finger-stick checks to calibrate the machine. Check your device\'s users guide to learn if you need to check, and if so, how often you need to do it.</p>\n<p>Certain medications, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), albuterol (Proair HFA, Ventolin HFA, others) and lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril, Qbrelis), may interfere with the accuracy of some CGM readings, particularly on older models of CGMs. Readings on newer CGMs don\'t seem to be affected by standard doses of acetaminophen (up to 1,000 milligrams for an adult).</p>\n<p>If you need to take medications that may affect the accuracy of the readings, your doctor may recommend double-checking your CGM results with a standard blood sugar meter. Check with your doctor about using a CGM if you\'re pregnant, on dialysis or critically ill, as these conditions may affect the blood sugar readings from a CGM.</p>\n<h3>Know your target range</h3>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<p>Ask your doctor what a reasonable blood sugar range is for you. Your doctor will set target blood sugar test results based on several factors, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Type and severity of diabetes</li>\n<li>Age</li>\n<li>How long you\'ve had diabetes</li>\n<li>Pregnancy status</li>\n<li>The presence of diabetes complications</li>\n<li>Overall health and the presence of other medical conditions</li>\n</ul>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<p>The American Diabetes Association (ADA) generally recommends the following target blood sugar levels:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Between 80 and 130 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or 4.4 to 7.2 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) before meals</li>\n<li>Less than 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L) two hours after meals</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But the ADA notes that these goals often vary depending on your age and personal health and should be individualized. For example, Mayo Clinic generally recommends that healthy adults under 60 can aim for slightly lower blood sugar targets.</p>\n<p>Some people will have slightly higher blood sugar goals, including people who:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are age 60 and older</li>\n<li>Have other medical conditions, such as heart, lung or kidney disease</li>\n<li>Have a reduced ability to sense low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia unawareness)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How to test your blood sugar</h3>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<p>Blood sugar testing requires the use of a blood sugar meter. The meter measures the amount of sugar in a small sample of blood, usually from your fingertip, that you place on a disposable test strip. Even if you use a CGM, you\'ll still need a blood sugar meter to calibrate your CGM device daily.</p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<p>Your doctor or diabetes educator can recommend an appropriate device for you. He or she can also help you learn how to use your meter.</p>\n<p>Follow the instructions that come with your blood sugar meter. In general, here\'s how the process works:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Wash and dry your hands well. (Food and other substances can give you an inaccurate reading.)</li>\n<li>Insert a test strip into your meter.</li>\n<li>Prick the side of your fingertip with the needle (lancet) provided with your test kit.</li>\n<li>Touch and hold the edge of the test strip to the drop of blood.</li>\n<li>The meter will display your blood sugar level on a screen after a few seconds.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Some meters can test blood taken from an alternate site, such as the forearm or palm. But these readings may not be as accurate as readings from the fingertips, especially after a meal or during exercise, when blood sugar levels change more frequently. Alternate sites aren\'t recommended for use in calibrating CGMs.</p>\n<h3>Recording your results</h3>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<p>Talk with your doctor about how often you need to record your blood sugar results. The readings given by many devices can now be downloaded to a computer.</p>\n<p>If you manually log your results, record the date, time, test results, medication and dose, and diet and exercise information. Bring your record of results with you to your doctor\'s appointments.</p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<p>Talk to your doctor about what steps to take if you get results that don\'t fall within the range of your target goals.</p>\n<h3>Avoiding problems with your meter</h3>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<p>Blood sugar meters need to be used and maintained properly. Follow these tips to ensure proper usage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check the users guide for your device for instructions &mdash; procedures may vary from one device to another.</li>\n<li>Use a blood sample size as directed in the users guide.</li>\n<li>Use only test strips designed for your meter.</li>\n<li>Store test strips as directed.</li>\n<li>Don\'t use expired test strips.</li>\n<li>Clean the device and run quality-control checks as directed.</li>\n<li>Bring the meter to your doctor\'s appointments to address any questions and to show how you use your meter.</li>\n</ul>','Blood sugar testing','2023-07-09 11:05:43','2023-07-09 11:05:43',NULL),(21,20,NULL,'Quitting Smoking','<h1>Why Quitting Smoking is Important:</h1>\n<p>&nbsp;Since 1964 when the Surgeon General of the United States released his report linking smoking to a wide range of respiratory diseases including cancer, Americans have known of the potential hazards of cigarette/ pipe use. Following that report, the rate of smoking in adults has gradually decreased from 42.4% in 1965, 20.9% in 2005, and 17.8% in 2013; 20.5% in men and 15.3% in women.. However, while we have made progress, there is still a great need to encourage tobacco cessation. We now know that smoking is responsible for many other diseases. Use of tobacco products has become the largest single preventable cause of death in America. Below is a brief discussion of some of the many links between smoking and systemic disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Tobacco Use and Systemic Diseases</strong><br /><strong>Cardiovascular Disease:</strong>&nbsp;Cigarette smoke damages the lining of blood vessels and begins the process of atherosclerosis (plaque that blocks the blood vessels). This in turn leads to all forms of heart disease including angina (chest pain), heart attack, irregular heart beats, stroke, and sudden death. In 2011, it was estimated that there were 174,500 deaths from cardiovascular diseases directly related to smoking; and 46,000 deaths from exposure to second hand smoke.</p>\n<p><strong>Lung Diseases:</strong>&nbsp;Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of respiratory diseases in the United States resulting in more than 84,000 deaths from bronchitis, emphysema, pneumonia, and chronic airway obstruction (COPD. Cigarette smoking directly causes over 90% of lung cancers; and secondhand smoke causes 3,000 lung cancer deaths annually in nonsmokers. One study estimates that 17% of lung cancer in nonsmokers results from exposure to tobacco smoke during their childhood years.</p>\n<p><strong>Gastrointestinal Diseases:</strong>&nbsp;Smoking is associated with an increased risk for GERD, gallstones stomach ulcers and cancer of the esophagus, stomach, pancreas, liver, and colon cancer.</p>\n<p><strong>Arthritis / Bone Disease:</strong>&nbsp;Smoking increases the risk for rheumatoid arthritis. Smokers have less bone mass than nonsmokers and the bone loss is more rapid in postmenopausal females who smoke.</p>\n<p><strong>Eye Disorders:</strong>&nbsp;Smoking increases the risk for cataracts and age-related macular degeneration.</p>\n<p><strong>Depression:</strong>&nbsp;Smokers are more likely to have depression and have more anxiety disorders, bulimia, attention-deficit disorders, alcohol abuse, and schizophrenia than non-smokers.</p>\n<p><strong>Specific Concerns for Women Who Smoke:</strong>&nbsp;The leading cancer killer in females is lung cancer. Since 1950, there has been a 600% increase in lung cancer deaths in smoking females. In 2015, 71,000 females will die from lung cancer. Women who smoke have an increased risk of infertility and spontaneous abortion. Complications caused by smoking during pregnancy include pre-term delivery, increased risk of stillbirth, lower birth weight, and decreased lung function in the developing child.</p>\n<p><strong>Oral Disease:</strong>&nbsp;Many oral diseases are directly linked to smoking and tobacco use. Please see PATIENT INFORMATION SHEET: Oral Changes Associated with Tobacco Use.</p>\n<p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong>&nbsp;The negative, harmful, addictive effects of tobacco products are clear. If you or a person that you care for smokes, please take action to stop. It can be done.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits of Stopping Smoking</strong><br />One of the many excuses for not stopping smoking is that the health damage has already been done and that the damage cannot be reversed. Please see PATIENT INFORMATION SHEET: Tobacco Use: Common Questions and Concerns. The following shows just how quickly you can benefit from stopping smoking:</p>\n<p><strong>After you smoke your last cigarette:</strong><br />Within 20 minutes your blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature will return to its normal values.<br />Within 24 hours your risk for having a heart attack begins to decrease.<br />Within 2 days your sense of smell and taste will begin to return. Food will taste and smell like it should.<br />Within 3 days your body is &ldquo;free&rdquo; of nicotine.<br />Within 3 weeks both your body and brain will no longer be dependent on nicotine.<br />Within 3 months your blood circulation and lung function has significantly improved.<br />Within one year you will have a large reduction in risk for both heart diseases and cancers.<br />Within 15 years your health risks are similar to those of a non-tobacco user.</p>\n<h3>Why should I quit smoking?</h3>\n<p>The decision to&nbsp;<a>quit smoking</a>&nbsp;is the most important step you can take to improve your overall health. It is NEVER too late to quit. By quitting smoking, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lengthen your life expectancy</li>\n<li>Decrease your risk of disease (including&nbsp;<a>lung cancer</a>, throat cancer, emphysema, heart disease,&nbsp;<a>high blood pressure</a>, ulcers and&nbsp;<a>reflux</a>, erectile and sexual dysfunction, kidney disease, and other conditions)</li>\n<li>Reduce your risk of respiratory and&nbsp;<a>anesthesia</a>&nbsp;complications during surgery and risk of infection or re-admission after an operation</li>\n<li>Decrease the chance that your children will become sick (respiratory and ear infections are much more common among children exposed to secondhand smoke)</li>\n<li>Feel healthier (after quitting, you won&rsquo;t cough as much, have as many sore throats or stuffy noses, and will have an increased energy level and exercise tolerance)</li>\n<li>Improve your sense of taste and smell</li>\n<li>Improve your personal life (smoking causes&nbsp;<a>erectile dysfunction</a>&nbsp;and overall sexual dysfunction)</li>\n<li>Improve your looks (smoking cause wrinkles, stained teeth, and dull skin)</li>\n<li>Save money &ndash; a 1 pack-per-day habit costs $2,200/year</li>\n</ul>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<h3>What&rsquo;s the best way to quit smoking?</h3>\n<p>There is no best way to quit smoking. Everyone has different smoking patterns, habits, levels of addiction, and preferences. What works best for one person may have little impact on someone else. For this reason, the best smoking cessation programs offer several proven methods, not just one.</p>\n<p>The Cleveland Clinic Tobacco Treatment Center offers a variety of methods to help people who want to become nonsmokers. Our program offers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An individualized treatment plan. A certified tobacco specialist determines how dependent you are on nicotine, how ready you are to quit, and your preferred method of learning. The specialist will develop a treatment plan specifically designed for you to give you the best chance of quitting successfully.</li>\n<li>Use of a combination of medications and behavioral therapy. Your treatment plan includes the latest tobacco treatment medications such as bupropion, varenicline, and/or nicotine replacement therapies (e.g., nicotine gum or the patch). Behavior therapies include exercise, reading material, and individual or group counseling.</li>\n<li>Follow-up. The tobacco treatment specialist follows up on your progress, offers tips and celebrates your successes. Cleveland Clinic Tobacco Cessation specialists developed the PQRS strategy to help you quit:\n<ul>\n<li>PREPARE: You need a little time before you quit &ndash;14 to 30 days is usually optimal &ndash; to prime your mind and body for success.</li>\n<li>QUIT: Anti-craving drugs and/or nicotine replacement therapy will lessen your urge to smoke. Resources are available to help you on your journey to a tobacco-free life.</li>\n<li>RELAPSE PREVENTION: Develop the ability to identify situations that may cause you to slip and learn new skills to prevent relapse.</li>\n<li><a>STRESS MANAGEMENT</a>: Find alternatives to reaching for tobacco to cope with stress. Tobacco actually INCREASES the stress on your body &ndash; it increases heart rate, blood pressure, and constricts blood vessels, making your heart, kidneys, and other vital organs work harder.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What\'s the next step?</h3>\n<p>Being ready and wanting to quit is the most important part. You need to decide to give yourself the most precious gift a smoker can give to him or herself &ndash; a gift of life, health, and self-esteem &ndash; by becoming a nonsmoker. Treatment costs less than a pack of cigarettes a day, and varies based on the personalized plan developed for each individual and his or her ability to pay.</p>','Quitting Smoking','2023-07-09 11:05:43','2023-07-09 11:05:43',NULL),(22,21,NULL,'Why Do We Need Sleep','<h1>Why Do We Need Sleep?</h1>\n<p>Sleep is an&nbsp;<a>essential function<sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp;that allows your body and mind to recharge, leaving you refreshed and alert when you wake up. Healthy sleep also helps the body remain healthy and stave off diseases. Without enough sleep, the brain cannot function properly. This can&nbsp;<a>impair your abilities<sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;to concentrate, think clearly, and process memories.</p>\n<p>Most adults require between&nbsp;<a>seven and nine hours<sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp;of nightly sleep. Children and teenagers need substantially more sleep, particularly if they are younger than five years of age. Work schedules, day-to-day stressors, a disruptive bedroom environment, and medical conditions can all prevent us from receiving enough sleep. A healthy diet and positive lifestyle habits can help ensure an&nbsp;<a>adequate amount of sleep</a>&nbsp;each night &ndash; but for some, chronic lack of sleep may be the first sign of a sleep disorder.</p>\n<h2>The Science Behind Sleep</h2>\n<p>An&nbsp;<a>internal &ldquo;body clock&rdquo;<sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp;regulates your sleep cycle, controlling when you feel tired and ready for bed or refreshed and alert. This clock operates on a 24-hour cycle known as the&nbsp;<a>circadian rhythm</a>. After waking up from sleep, you&rsquo;ll become increasingly tired throughout the day. These feelings will peak in the evening leading up to bedtime.</p>\n<p>This sleep drive &ndash; also known as sleep-wake homeostasis &ndash; may be linked to adenosine, an organic compound produced in the brain. Adenosine levels increase throughout the day as you become more tired, and then the body breaks down this compound during sleep.</p>\n<p><a>Light</a>&nbsp;also influences the circadian rhythm. The brain contains a special region of nerve cells known as the hypothalamus, and a cluster of cells in the hypothalamus called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which processes signals when the eyes are exposed to natural or artificial light. These signals help the brain determine whether it is day or night.</p>\n<p>As&nbsp;<a>natural light</a>&nbsp;disappears in the evening, the body will release melatonin, a hormone that induces drowsiness. When the sun rises in the morning, the body will release the hormone known as cortisol that promotes energy and alertness.</p>\n<h3>Stages of Sleep</h3>\n<p>Once we fall asleep, our bodies follow a sleep cycle divided into&nbsp;<a>four stages</a>. The first three stages are known as&nbsp;<strong>non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep</strong>, and the final stage is known as&nbsp;<strong>rapid eye movement (REM) sleep</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stage 1 NREM</strong>: This first stage marks the transition between wakefulness and sleep, and consists of light sleep. Muscles relax and your heart rate, breathing, and eye movements begin to slow down, as do your brain waves, which are more active when you are awake. Stage 1 typically lasts several minutes.</li>\n<li><strong>Stage 2 NREM</strong>: This second NREM sleep stage is characterized by deeper sleep as your heart rate and breathing rates continue slowing down and the muscles become more relaxed. Eye movements will cease and your body temperature will decrease. Apart from some brief moments of higher frequency electrical activity, brain waves also remain slow. Stage 2 is typically the longest of the four sleep stages.</li>\n<li><strong>Stage 3 NREM</strong>: This stage plays an important role in making you feel refreshed and alert the next day. Heartbeat, breathing, and brain wave activity all reach their lowest levels, and the muscles are as relaxed as they will be. This stage will be longer at first and decrease in duration throughout the night.</li>\n<li><strong>REM</strong>: The first REM stage will occur about 90 minutes after you fall asleep. As the name suggests, your eyes will move back and forth rather quickly under your eyelids. Breathing rate, heart rate, and blood pressure will begin to increase. Dreaming will typically occur during REM sleep, and your arms and legs will become paralyzed &ndash; it&rsquo;s believed this is intended to prevent you from physically acting out on your dreams. The duration of each REM sleep cycle increases as the night progresses. Numerous studies have also linked REM sleep to&nbsp;<a>memory consolidation<sup>5</sup></a>, the process of converting recently learned experiences into long-term memories. The duration of the REM stage will decrease as you age, causing you to spend more time in the NREM stages.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These four stages will repeat cyclically throughout the night until you wake up. For most people, the duration of each cycle will last about&nbsp;<a>90-120 minutes<sup>6</sup></a>. NREM sleep constitutes about 75% to 80% of each cycle. You may also wake up briefly during the night but not remember the next day. These episodes are known as &ldquo;W&rdquo; stages.</p>\n<h2>How Much Sleep Do Humans Need?</h2>\n<p>The right amount of sleep largely depends on your age. The National Sleep Foundation recommends the following&nbsp;<a>daily sleep allotment</a>&nbsp;for different age groups.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Age Group</th>\n<th>Age Range</th>\n<th>Recommended Amount of Sleep per Day</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Newborn</td>\n<td>0-3 months</td>\n<td>14-17 hours</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Infant</td>\n<td>4-11 months</td>\n<td>12-15 hours</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Toddler</td>\n<td>1-2 years</td>\n<td>11-14 hours</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Preschool</td>\n<td>3-5 years</td>\n<td>10-13 hours</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>School-age</td>\n<td>6-13 years</td>\n<td>9-11 hours</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Teen</td>\n<td>14-17 years</td>\n<td>8-10 hours</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Young Adult</td>\n<td>18-25 years</td>\n<td>7-9 hours</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Adult</td>\n<td>26-64 years</td>\n<td>7-9 hours</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Older Adult</td>\n<td>65 years or older</td>\n<td>7-8 hours</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>The Importance of Getting Enough Sleep</h2>\n<p>For most adults,&nbsp;<a>at least seven hours of sleep<sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;each night is needed for proper cognitive and behavioral functions. An insufficient amount of sleep can lead to serious repercussions. Some studies have shown sleep deprivation leaves people vulnerable to attention lapses, reduced cognition, delayed reactions, and mood shifts.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s also been suggested that people can develop a sort of tolerance to chronic sleep deprivation. Even though their brains and bodies struggle due to lack of sleep, they may not be aware of their own deficiencies because less sleep feels normal to them. Additionally, lack of sleep has been linked to a higher risk for certain diseases and medical conditions. These include obesity, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke,&nbsp;<a>poor mental health</a>, and early death.</p>\n<p>Adults who do not receive a sufficient amount of sleep each night can implement some positive lifestyle and sleep habits in order to log the needed seven to nine hours. These include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Establish a realistic bedtime and stick to it every night, even on the weekends.</li>\n<li>Maintain comfortable temperature settings and low light levels in your bedroom.</li>\n<li>Consider a &ldquo;screen ban&rdquo; on televisions, computers and tablets, cell phones, and other electronic devices in your bedroom.</li>\n<li>Abstain from caffeine, alcohol, and large meals in the hours leading up to bedtime.</li>\n<li>Refrain from using tobacco at any time of day or night.</li>\n<li>Exercise during the day; this can help you wind down in the evening and prepare for sleep.</li>\n</ul>','Why Do We Need Sleep','2023-07-09 11:05:43','2023-07-09 11:05:43',NULL),(23,22,NULL,'Dengue fever','<h1><a>Dengue fever:</a></h1>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Dengue (DENG-gey) fever is a mosquito-borne illness that occurs in tropical and subtropical areas of the world.

The parasite is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes. People who have malaria usually feel very sick, with a high fever and shaking chills. Each year, approximately 210 million people are infected with malaria, and about 440,000 people die from the disease. Most of the people who die from the disease are young children in Africa.</p>\r <div>&nbsp;</div>\r <p>While the disease is uncommon in temperate climates, malaria is still common in tropical and subtropical countries. World health officials are trying to reduce the incidence of malaria by distributing bed nets to help protect people from mosquito bites as they sleep. Scientists around the world are working to develop a vaccine to prevent malaria.</p>\r <p>If you\'re traveling to locations where malaria is common, take steps to prevent mosquito bites by wearing protective clothing, using insect repellants and sleeping under treated mosquito nets. Depending on the area you are visiting and your individual risk factors for infection, you may also want to take preventive medicine before, during and after your trip. Many malaria parasites are now resistant to the most common drugs used to treat the disease.</p>\r <h2>Symptoms</h2>\r <p>A malaria infection is generally characterized by the following signs and symptoms:</p>\r <ul>\r <li>Fever</li>\r <li>Chills</li>\r <li>Headache</li>\r <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>\r <li>Muscle pain and fatigue</li>\r </ul>\r <p>Other signs and symptoms may include:</p>\r <ul>\r <li>Sweating</li>\r <li>Chest or abdominal pain</li>\r <li>Cough</li>\r </ul>\r <p>Some people who have malaria experience cycles of malaria \"attacks.\" An attack usually starts with shivering and chills, followed by a high fever, followed by sweating and a return to normal temperature. Malaria signs and symptoms typically begin within a few weeks after being bitten by an infected mosquito. However, some types of malaria parasites can lie dormant in your body for up to a year.</p>\r <h3>When to see a doctor</h3>\r <p>Talk to your doctor if you experience a fever while living in or after traveling to a high-risk malaria region. The parasites that cause malaria can lie dormant in your body for up to a year. If you have severe symptoms, seek emergency medical attention.</p>\r <h2>Causes</h2>\r <p>Malaria is caused by a type of microscopic parasite. The parasite is transmitted to humans most commonly through mosquito bites.</p>\r <h3>Mosquito transmission cycle</h3>\r <ul>\r <li><strong>Uninfected mosquito.</strong>&nbsp;A mosquito becomes infected by feeding on a person who has malaria.</li>\r <li><strong>Transmission of parasite.</strong>&nbsp;If this mosquito bites you in the future, it can transmit malaria parasites to you.</li>\r <li><strong>In the liver.</strong>&nbsp;Once the parasites enter your body, they travel to your liver &mdash; where some types can lie dormant for as long as a year.</li>\r <li><strong>Into the bloodstream.</strong>&nbsp;When the parasites mature, they leave the liver and infect your red blood cells. This is when people typically develop malaria symptoms.</li>\r <li><strong>On to the next person.</strong>&nbsp;If an uninfected mosquito bites you at this point in the cycle, it will become infected with your malaria parasites and can spread them to the other people it bites.</li>\r </ul>\r <h3>Other modes of transmission</h3>\r <p>Because the parasites that cause malaria affect red blood cells, people can also catch malaria from exposure to infected blood, including:</p>\r <ul>\r <li>From mother to unborn child</li>\r <li>Through blood transfusions</li>\r <li>By sharing needles used to inject drugs</li>\r </ul>\r <h2>Risk factors</h2>\r <p>The biggest risk factor for developing malaria is to live in or to visit areas where the disease is common. There are many different varieties of malaria parasites. The variety that causes the most serious complications is most commonly found in:</p>\r <ul>\r <li>African countries south of the Sahara Desert</li>\r <li>The Asian subcontinent</li>\r <li>New Guinea, the Dominican Republic and Haiti</li>\r </ul>\r <h3>Risks of more-severe disease</h3>\r <p>People at increased risk of serious disease include:</p>\r <ul>\r <li>Young children and infants</li>\r <li>Older adults</li>\r <li>Travelers coming from areas with no malaria</li>\r <li>Pregnant women and their unborn children</li>\r </ul>\r <p>Poverty, lack of knowledge, and little or no access to health care also contribute to malaria deaths worldwide.</p>\r <h3>Immunity can wane</h3>\r <p>Residents of a malaria region may be exposed to the disease so frequently that they acquire a partial immunity, which can lessen the severity of malaria symptoms. However, this partial immunity can disappear if you move to a country where you\'re no longer frequently exposed to the parasite.</p>\r <h2>Complications</h2>\r <p>Malaria can be fatal, particularly malaria caused by the variety of parasite that\'s common in tropical parts of Africa. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 91 percent of all malaria deaths occur in Africa &mdash; most commonly in children under the age of 5.</p>\r <p>In most cases, malaria deaths are related to one or more serious complications, including:</p>\r <ul>\r <li><strong>Cerebral malaria.</strong>&nbsp;If parasite-filled blood cells block small blood vessels to your brain (cerebral malaria), swelling of your brain or brain damage may occur. Cerebral malaria may cause seizures and coma.</li>\r <li><strong>Breathing problems.</strong>&nbsp;Accumulated fluid in your lungs (pulmonary edema) can make it difficult to breathe.</li>\r <li><strong>Organ failure.</strong>&nbsp;Malaria can cause your kidneys or liver to fail, or your spleen to rupture. Any of these conditions can be life-threatening.</li>\r <li><strong>Anemia.</strong>&nbsp;Malaria damages red blood cells, which can result in anemia.</li>\r <li><strong>Low blood sugar.</strong>&nbsp;Severe forms of malaria itself can cause low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), as can quinine &mdash; one of the most common medications used to combat malaria. Very low blood sugar can result in coma or death.</li>\r </ul>\r <h3>Malaria may recur</h3>\r <p>Some varieties of the malaria parasite, which typically cause milder forms of the disease, can persist for years and cause relapses.</p>\r <h2>Prevention</h2>\r <p>If you live in or are traveling to an area where malaria is common, take steps to avoid mosquito bites. Mosquitoes are most active between dusk and dawn. To protect yourself from mosquito bites, you should:</p>\r <ul>\r <li><strong>Cover your skin.</strong>&nbsp;Wear pants and long-sleeved shirts.</li>\r <li><strong>Apply insect repellant to skin and clothing.</strong>&nbsp;Sprays containing DEET can be used on skin and sprays containing permethrin are safe to apply to clothing.</li>\r <li><strong>Sleep under a net.</strong>&nbsp;Bed nets, particularly those treated with insecticide, help prevent mosquito bites while you are sleeping.</li>\r </ul>\r <h3>Preventive medicine</h3>\r <p>If you\'re going to be traveling to a location where malaria is common, talk to your doctor a few months ahead of time about whether you should take drugs before, during and after your trip to help protect you from malaria parasites.</p>\r <p>In general, the drugs taken to prevent malaria are the same drugs used to treat the disease. Your doctor needs to know when and where you\'ll be traveling so that he or she can help you evaluate your risk for infection and, if necessary, prescribe the drug that will work best on the type of malaria parasite most commonly found in that region.</p>\r <h3>No vaccine yet</h3>\r <p>Scientists around the world are trying to develop a safe and effective vaccine for malaria. As of yet, however, there is still no malaria vaccine approved for human use.</p>\r <p>&nbsp;</p>\r <h2>The Mayo Clinic experience and patient stories</h2>\r <p>Our patients tell us that the quality of their interactions, our attention to detail and the efficiency of their visits mean health care like they\'ve never experienced. See the stories of satisfied Mayo Clinic patients.</p>\r <h2>Diagnosis</h2>\r <p>To diagnose malaria, your doctor will likely review your medical history, conduct a physical exam and order blood tests. Blood tests are the only way to confirm a malaria diagnosis. Certain blood tests can help your doctor by showing:</p>\r <ul>\r <li>The presence of the parasite in the blood, to confirm that you have malaria</li>\r <li>Which type of malaria parasite is causing your symptoms</li>\r <li>If your infection is caused by a parasite resistant to certain drugs</li>\r </ul>\r <div>&nbsp;</div>\r <p>Other blood tests help determine whether the disease is causing any serious complications.</p>\r <p>Some blood tests can take several days to complete, while others can produce results in less than 15 minutes.</p>\r <h2>Treatment</h2>\r <p>Malaria is treated with prescription drugs to kill the parasite. The types of drugs and the length of treatment will vary, depending on:</p>\r <ul>\r <li>Which type of malaria parasite you have</li>\r <li>The severity of your symptoms</li>\r <li>Your age</li>\r <li>Whether you\'re pregnant</li>\r </ul>\r <h3>Medication</h3>\r <p>The most common antimalarial drugs include:</p>\r <ul>\r <li><strong>Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs).</strong>&nbsp;ACTs are, in many cases, the first line treatment for malaria. There are several different types of ACTs. Examples include artemether-lumefantrine (Coartem) and artesunate-amodiaquine. Each ACT is a combination of two or more drugs that work against the malaria parasite in different ways.</li>\r <li><strong>Chloroquine phosphate.</strong>&nbsp;Chloroquine is the preferred treatment for any parasite that is sensitive to the drug. But in many parts of the world, the parasites that cause malaria are resistant to chloroquine, and the drug is no longer an effective treatment.</li>\r </ul>\r <p>Other common antimalarial drugs include:</p>\r <ul>\r <li>Combination of atovaquone and proguanil (Malarone)</li>\r <li>Quinine sulfate (Qualaquin) with doxycycline (Vibramycin, Monodox, others)</li>\r <li>Mefloquine</li>\r <li>Primaquine phosphate</li>\r </ul>\r <h3>Possible future treatments</h3>\r <p>New antimalarial drugs are being researched and developed. Malaria treatment is marked by a constant struggle between evolving drug-resistant parasites and the search for new drug formulations. For example, one variety of the malaria parasite has demonstrated resistance to nearly all of the available antimalarial drugs.</p>\r <h2>Preparing for your appointment</h2>\r <p>If you suspect you have malaria or that you\'ve been exposed, you\'re likely to start by seeing your family doctor. However, in some cases when you call to set up an appointment, you may be referred to an infectious disease specialist. If you have severe symptoms &mdash; especially during or after travel in an area where malaria is common &mdash; seek emergency medical attention.</p>\r <h3>What you can do</h3>\r <p>Before your appointment, you might want to write a list that answers the following questions:</p>\r <ul>\r <li>What are your symptoms, and when did they start?</li>\r <li>Have you recently traveled to or moved from a region in which malaria is common?</li>\r <li>Have you ever had malaria before?</li>\r <li>What types of medications and supplements do you take?</li>\r </ul>\r <h3>What to expect from your doctor</h3><p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/-zwfDBDsffI\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" class=\"note-video-clip\"></iframe><br></p>\r <p>During the physical exam, your doctor may review your medical history, listen to your breathing, check your spleen and neurological functions, and look for other causes of a fever.</p>','Malaria','2023-07-09 11:05:43','2023-07-09 11:05:43',NULL),(25,24,NULL,'Polio','<h1>Polio:</h1>\n<div>\n<h2>What is polio?</h2>\n<p>Polio (also known as poliomyelitis) is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus that attacks the nervous system. Children younger than 5 years old are more likely to contract the virus than any other group.</p>\n<p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 1 in 200 polio infections will result in permanent&nbsp;<a>paralysis</a>. However, thanks to the global polio eradication initiative in 1988, the following regions are now certified polio-free:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Americas</li>\n<li>Europe</li>\n<li>Western Pacific</li>\n<li>Southeast Asia</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The polio vaccine was developed in 1953 and made available in 1957. Since then cases of polio have dropped in United States.</p>\n<div >\n<div><a>HealthGrove | Graphiq</a></div>\n<p>But polio is still persistent in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria. Eliminating polio will benefit the world in terms of health and economy. The eradication of polio can save at least $40&ndash;50 billion over the next 20 years.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div><a ></a>What are the symptoms of polio?</div>\n<p>It&rsquo;s estimated that 95 to 99 percent of people who contract poliovirus are asymptomatic. This is known as subclinical polio. Even without symptoms, people infected with poliovirus can still spread the virus and cause infection in others.</p>\n<h3>Non-paralytic polio</h3>\n<p>Signs and symptoms of non-paralytic polio can last from one to 10 days. These signs and symptoms can be flu-like and can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a >fever</a></li>\n<li><a>sore throat</a></li>\n<li><a>headache</a></li>\n<li><a>vomiting</a></li>\n<li><a >fatigue</a></li>\n<li><a >meningitis</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Non-paralytic polio is also known as abortive polio.</p>\n<h3>Paralytic polio</h3>\n<p>About 1 percent of polio cases can develop into paralytic polio. Paralytic polio leads to paralysis in the&nbsp;<a >spinal cord</a>&nbsp;(spinal polio),&nbsp;<a>brainstem</a>&nbsp;(bulbar polio), or both (bulbospinal polio).</p>\n<p>Initial symptoms are similar to non-paralytic polio. But after a week, more severe symptoms will appear. These symptoms include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>loss of reflexes</li>\n<li>severe spasms and muscle pain</li>\n<li>loose and floppy limbs, sometimes on just one side of the body</li>\n<li>sudden paralysis, temporary or permanent</li>\n<li>deformed limbs, especially the hips, ankles, and feet</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It&rsquo;s rare for full paralysis to develop.&nbsp;<a >Less than 1 percent<span><span>Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;of all polio cases will result in permanent paralysis. In 5&ndash;10 percent of the polio paralysis cases, the virus will attack the muscles that help you breathe and cause death.</p>\n<h3>Post-polio syndrome</h3>\n<p>It&rsquo;s possible for polio to return even after you&rsquo;ve recovered. This can occur after 15 to 40 years. Common symptoms of post-polio syndrome (PPS) are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>continuing muscle and joint weakness</li>\n<li>muscle pain that gets worse</li>\n<li>becoming easily exhausted or fatigued</li>\n<li><a>muscle wasting</a>, also called muscle atrophy</li>\n<li>trouble breathing and swallowing</li>\n<li><a>sleep apnea</a>, or sleep-related breathing problems</li>\n<li>low tolerance of cold temperatures</li>\n<li>new onset of weakness in previously uninvolved muscles</li>\n<li><a>depression</a></li>\n<li>trouble with concentration and memory</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Talk to your doctor if you&rsquo;ve had polio and are starting to see these symptoms. It&rsquo;s estimated that&nbsp;<a>25 to 50 percent</a>&nbsp;of people who survived polio will get PPS. PPS can&rsquo;t be caught by others having this disorder. Treatment involves management strategies to improve your quality of life and reduce pain or fatigue.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div><a></a>How does the poliovirus infect someone?</div>\n<p>As a highly contagious virus, polio transmits through contact with infected feces. Objects like toys that have come near infected feces can also transmit the virus. Sometimes it can transmit through a sneeze or a cough, as the virus lives in the throat and intestines. This is less common.</p>\n<p>People living in areas with limited access to running water or flush toilets often contract polio from drinking water contaminated by infected human waste. According to the&nbsp;<a>Mayo Clinic</a>, the virus is so contagious that anyone living with someone who has the virus can catch it too.</p>\n<p>Pregnant women, people with weakened immune systems &mdash; such as those who are HIV-positive &mdash; and young children are the most susceptible to the poliovirus.</p>\n<p>If you have not been vaccinated, you can increase your risk of contracting polio when you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>travel to an area that has had a recent polio outbreak</li>\n<li>take care of or live with someone infected with polio</li>\n<li>handle a laboratory specimen of the virus</li>\n<li>have your tonsils removed</li>\n<li>have extreme stress or strenuous activity after exposure to the virus</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<div><a></a>How do doctors diagnose polio?</div>\n<p>Your doctor will diagnose polio by looking at your symptoms. They&rsquo;ll perform a&nbsp;<a>physical examination</a>&nbsp;and look for impaired reflexes, back and neck stiffness, or difficulty lifting your head while lying flat.</p>\n<p>Labs will also test a sample of your throat, stool, or cerebrospinal fluid for the poliovirus.</p>\n<div >&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<div >\n<div><a></a>How do doctors treat polio?</div>\n<p>Doctors can only treat the symptoms while the infection runs its course. But since there&rsquo;s no cure, the best way to treat polio is to prevent it with vaccinations.</p>\n<p>The most common supportive treatments include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>bed rest</li>\n<li>painkillers</li>\n<li>antispasmodic drugs to relax muscles</li>\n<li>antibiotics for urinary tract infections</li>\n<li>portable ventilators to help with breathing</li>\n<li>physical therapy or corrective braces to help with walking</li>\n<li>heating pads or warm towels to ease muscle aches and spasms</li>\n<li>physical therapy to treat pain in the affected muscles</li>\n<li>physical therapy to address breathing and pulmonary problems</li>\n<li>pulmonary rehabilitation to increase lung endurance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In advanced cases of leg weakness, you may need a wheelchair or other mobility device.</p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<div >&nbsp;</div>\n<div >\n<div><a></a>How to prevent polio</div>\n<p>The best way to prevent polio is to get the vaccination.

They can also exhibit confusion or a lower than normal body temperature.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<div>Causes of pneumonia</div>\n<p>There are several types of infectious agents that can cause pneumonia.</p>\n<h3>Bacterial pneumonia</h3>\n<p>The most common cause of&nbsp;<a>bacterial pneumonia</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>. Other causes include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</a></li>\n<li><em>Haemophilus influenzae</em></li>\n<li><a>Legionella pneumophila</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Viral pneumonia</h3>\n<p>Respiratory viruses are often the cause of pneumonia. Some examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>influenza (<a>flu</a>)</li>\n<li><a>respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)</a></li>\n<li><a>rhinoviruses</a>&nbsp;(common cold)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a>Viral pneumonia</a>&nbsp;is usually milder and can improve in one to three weeks without treatment.</p>\n<h3>Fungal pneumonia</h3>\n<p>Fungi from soil or bird droppings can cause pneumonia. They most often cause pneumonia in people with&nbsp;<a>weakened immune systems</a>. Examples of fungi that can cause pneumonia include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em></li>\n<li><em>Cryptococcus</em>&nbsp;species</li>\n<li><a>Histoplasmosis</a>&nbsp;species</li>\n</ul>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n<div>Types of pneumonia</div>\n<p>Pneumonia can also be classified according to where or how it was acquired.</p>\n<h3>Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)</h3>\n<p>This type of bacterial pneumonia is acquired during a hospital stay. It can be more serious than other types, as the bacteria involved may be more&nbsp;<a>resistant to antibiotics</a>.</p>\n<h3>Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)</h3>\n<p><strong>Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)&nbsp;</strong>refers to pneumonia that&rsquo;s acquired outside of a medical or institutional setting.</p>\n<h3>Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)</h3>\n<p>When people who are using a ventilator get pneumonia, it&rsquo;s called VAP.</p>\n<h3>Aspiration pneumonia</h3>\n<p><a>Aspiration pneumonia</a>&nbsp;happens when you inhale bacteria into your lungs from food, drink, or saliva. This type is more likely to occur if you have a swallowing problem or if you&rsquo;re too sedate from the use of medications, alcohol, or other drugs.</p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>Pneumonia treatment</div>\n<p>Your treatment will depend on the type of pneumonia you have, how severe it is, and your general health.</p>\n<h3>Prescription medications</h3>\n<p>Your doctor may prescribe a medication to help treat your pneumonia. What you&rsquo;re prescribed will depend on the specific cause of your pneumonia.</p>\n<p>Oral&nbsp;<a>antibiotics</a>&nbsp;can treat most cases of bacterial pneumonia. Always take your entire course of antibiotics, even if you begin to feel better. Not doing so can prevent the infection from clearing, and it may be harder to treat in the future.</p>\n<p>Antibiotic medications don&rsquo;t work on viruses. In some cases, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral. However, many cases of viral pneumonia clear on their own with at-home care.</p>\n<p>Antifungal medications are used to fight fungal pneumonia. You may have to take this medication for several weeks to clear the infection.</p>\n<h3>At-home care</h3>\n<p>Your doctor may also recommend over-the-counter (OTC) medication to relieve your pain and fever, as needed. These may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a>aspirin</a></li>\n<li><a>ibuprofen</a>&nbsp;(Advil, Motrin)</li>\n<li><a>acetaminophen</a>&nbsp;(Tylenol)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your doctor may also recommend cough medicine to calm your cough so you can rest. Keep in mind coughing helps remove fluid from your lungs, so you don&rsquo;t want to eliminate it entirely.</p>\n<p>You can help your recovery and prevent a recurrence by getting a lot of rest and drinking plenty of fluids.</p>\n<h3>Hospitalization</h3>\n<p>If your symptoms are very severe or you have other health problems, you may need to be hospitalized. At the hospital, doctors can keep track of your heart rate, temperature, and breathing. Hospital treatment may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a>intravenous antibiotics</a>&nbsp;injected into a vein</li>\n<li><a>respiratory therapy</a>, which involves delivering specific medications directly into the lungs or teaching you to perform breathing exercises to maximize your oxygenation</li>\n<li><a>oxygen therapy</a>&nbsp;to maintain oxygen levels in your bloodstream (received through a nasal tube, face mask, or ventilator, depending on severity)</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<div>Pneumonia risk factors</div>\n<p>Anyone can get pneumonia, but certain groups do have a higher risk. These groups include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>infants from birth to 2 years old</li>\n<li>people ages 65 years and older</li>\n<li>people with weakened immune systems because of disease or use of medications, such as steroids or certain cancer drugs</li>\n<li>people with certain chronic medical conditions, such as&nbsp;<a>asthma</a>,&nbsp;<a>cystic fibrosis</a>,&nbsp;<a>diabetes</a>, or&nbsp;<a>heart failure</a></li>\n<li>people who&rsquo;ve recently had a respiratory infection, such as a&nbsp;<a>cold</a>&nbsp;or the&nbsp;<a>flu</a></li>\n<li>people who&rsquo;ve been recently or are currently hospitalized, particularly if they were or are on a ventilator</li>\n<li>people who&rsquo;ve had a&nbsp;<a>stroke</a>, have problems swallowing, or have a condition that causes immobility</li>\n<li>people who smoke, use certain types of drugs, or drink excessive amounts of alcohol</li>\n<li>people who&rsquo;ve been exposed to lung irritants, such as pollution, fumes, and certain chemicals</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>Pneumonia prevention</div>\n<p>In many cases, pneumonia can be prevented.</p>\n<h3>Vaccination</h3>\n<p>The first line of defense against pneumonia is to get vaccinated. There are several vaccines that can help prevent pneumonia.</p>\n<p><strong>Prevnar 13 and Pneumovax 23</strong></p>\n<p>These two pneumonia vaccines help protect against pneumonia and&nbsp;<a>meningitis</a>&nbsp;caused by pneumococcal bacteria. Your doctor can tell you which one might be better for you.</p>\n<p><strong>Prevnar 13</strong>&nbsp;is effective against 13 types of pneumococcal bacteria. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&nbsp;<a>recommendsTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;this vaccine for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>children under the age of 2</li>\n<li>adults ages 65 years and older</li>\n<li>people between ages 2 and 64 years with chronic conditions that increase their risk for pneumonia</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Pneumovax 23&nbsp;</strong>is effective against 23 types of pneumococcal bacteria. The CDC&nbsp;<a>recommends<span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></a>&nbsp;it for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>adults ages 65 years and older</li>\n<li>adults ages 19 to 64 years who smoke</li>\n<li>people between ages 2 and 64 years with chronic conditions that increase their risk for pneumonia</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Flu vaccine</strong></p>\n<p>Pneumonia can often be a complication of the flu, so be sure to also get an annual&nbsp;<a>flu shot</a>. The CDC&nbsp;<a>recommendsTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;that everyone ages 6 months and older get vaccinated, particularly those who may be at risk for flu complications.</p>\n<p><strong>Hib vaccine</strong></p>\n<p>This vaccine protects against&nbsp;<em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>&nbsp;type b (Hib), a type of bacteria that can cause pneumonia and meningitis. The CDC&nbsp;<a>recommendsTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;this vaccine for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>all children under 5 years old</li>\n<li>unvaccinated older children or adults who have certain health conditions</li>\n<li>individuals who&rsquo;ve gotten a bone marrow transplant</li>\n</ul>\n<p>According to the&nbsp;<a>National Institutes of Health (NIH)<span class=\"sro\">Trusted Source</span></a>, pneumonia vaccines won&rsquo;t prevent all cases of the condition. But if you&rsquo;re vaccinated, you&rsquo;re likely to have a milder and shorter illness as well as a lower risk for complications.</p>\n<h3>Other prevention tips</h3>\n<p>In addition to vaccination, there are other things you can to avoid pneumonia:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you smoke, try to&nbsp;<a>quit</a>. Smoking makes you more susceptible to respiratory infections, especially pneumonia.</li>\n<li>Regularly wash your hands with soap and water.</li>\n<li>Cover your coughs and sneezes. Promptly dispose used tissues.</li>\n<li>Maintain a healthy lifestyle to strengthen your immune system. Get enough&nbsp;<a>rest</a>, eat a&nbsp;<a>healthy diet</a>, and get&nbsp;<a>regular exercise</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Together with vaccination and additional prevention steps, you can help reduce your risk for getting pneumonia.&nbsp;<a>Here are even more prevention tips.</a></p>\n<div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>Pneumonia diagnosis</div>\n<p>Your doctor will start by taking your medical history. They&rsquo;ll ask you questions about when your symptoms first appeared and your health in general.</p>\n<p>They&rsquo;ll then give you a physical exam. This will include listening to your lungs with a stethoscope for any abnormal sounds, such as&nbsp;<a>crackling</a>. Depending on the severity of your symptoms and your risk for complications, your doctor may also order one or more of these tests:</p>\n<h3>Chest X-ray</h3>\n<p>An&nbsp;<a>X-ray</a>&nbsp;helps your doctor look for signs of inflammation in your chest. If inflammation is present, the X-ray can also inform your doctor about its location and extent.</p>\n<h3>Blood culture</h3>\n<p>This test uses a blood sample to confirm an infection. Culturing can also help identify what may be causing your condition.</p>\n<h3>Sputum culture</h3>\n<p>During a&nbsp;<a>sputum culture</a>, a sample of mucus is collected after you&rsquo;ve coughed deeply. It&rsquo;s then sent to a lab to be analyzed to identify the cause of the infection.</p>\n<h3>Pulse oximetry</h3>\n<p>A&nbsp;<a>pulse oximetry</a>&nbsp;measures the amount of oxygen in your blood. A sensor placed on one of your fingers can indicate whether your lungs are moving enough oxygen through your bloodstream.</p>\n<h3>CT scan</h3>\n<p><a>CT scan</a>s provide a clearer and more detailed picture of your lungs.</p>\n<h3>Fluid sample</h3>\n<p>If your doctor suspects there&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a>fluid in the pleural space</a>&nbsp;of your chest, they may take a&nbsp;<a>fluid sample</a>&nbsp;using a needle placed between your ribs. This test can help identify the cause of your infection.</p>\n<h3>Bronchoscopy</h3>\n<p>A&nbsp;<a>bronchoscopy</a>&nbsp;looks into the airways in your lungs. It does this using a camera on the end of a flexible tube that&rsquo;s gently guided down your throat and into your lungs. Your doctor may do this test if your initial symptoms are severe, or if you&rsquo;re hospitalized and not responding well to antibiotics.</p>\n</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n<div>Walking pneumonia</div>\n<p><a>Walking pneumonia</a>&nbsp;is a milder case of pneumonia. People with walking pneumonia may not even know they have pneumonia, as their symptoms may feel more like a mild respiratory infection than pneumonia.</p>\n<p>The symptoms of walking pneumonia can include things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>mild fever</li>\n<li>dry cough lasting longer than a week</li>\n<li>chills</li>\n<li>shortness of breath</li>\n<li>chest pain</li>\n<li>reduced appetite</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, viruses and bacteria, like&nbsp;<em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>Haemophilus influenzae,</em>&nbsp;often cause pneumonia. However, in walking pneumonia, bacteria like&nbsp;<a>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</a>,&nbsp;<em>Chlamydophilia pneumoniae,</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a>Legionella pneumoniae</a>&nbsp;cause the condition.</p>\n<p>Despite being milder, walking pneumonia may require a longer recovery period than pneumonia.</p>\n</div>\n<div >\n<div><a ></a>Is pneumonia a virus?</div>\n<p>Several different types of infectious agents can cause pneumonia.&nbsp;<a>Viruses</a>&nbsp;are just one of them. The others include bacteria and fungi.</p>\n<p>Some examples of viral infections that can cause pneumonia include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>influenza (<a>flu</a>)</li>\n<li><a >RSV</a>&nbsp;infection</li>\n<li><a >rhinoviruses</a>&nbsp;(common cold)</li>\n<li>human&nbsp;<a>parainfluenza</a>&nbsp;virus (HPIV) infection</li>\n<li>human metapneumovirus (HMPV) infection</li>\n<li><a >measles</a></li>\n<li><a >chickenpox</a>&nbsp;(varicella-zoster virus)</li>\n<li><a >adenovirus</a>&nbsp;infection</li>\n<li>coronavirus infection</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although the symptoms of viral and bacterial pneumonia are very similar, cases of viral pneumonia are often milder than those of bacterial pneumonia. According to the&nbsp;<a>NIH<span ><span >Trusted Source</span></span></a>, people with viral pneumonia are at risk for developing bacterial pneumonia.</p>\n<p>One big difference between viral and bacterial pneumonia is treatment. Viral infections don&rsquo;t respond to antibiotics. Many cases of viral pneumonia may be treated with at-home care, although antivirals may sometimes be prescribed.</p>\n</div>\n<div >\n<div><a ></a>Pneumonia vs. bronchitis</div>\n<p>Pneumonia and&nbsp;<a>bronchitis</a>&nbsp;are two different conditions. Pneumonia is an inflammation of the air sacs in your lungs. Bronchitis is the inflammation of your&nbsp;<a>bronchial tubes</a>. These are the tubes that lead from your windpipe into your lungs.</p>\n<p>Infections cause both pneumonia and&nbsp;<a >acute bronchitis</a>. Additionally, persistent or&nbsp;<a >chronic bronchitis</a>&nbsp;can develop from inhaling pollutants, like cigarette smoke.</p>\n<p>A viral or bacterial infection can lead to a bout of acute bronchitis. If the condition remains untreated, it can develop into pneumonia. Sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to tell if this has happened. The symptoms of bronchitis and pneumonia are very similar.</p>\n<p>If you have bronchitis, it&rsquo;s important to get it treated to&nbsp;<a>prevent developing pneumonia</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div >\n<div><a ></a>Pneumonia in kids</div>\n<p>Pneumonia can be a rather common childhood condition. Researchers estimate there are&nbsp;<a>120 million<span><span>Trusted Source</span></span></a>&nbsp;cases of pediatric pneumonia worldwide each year.</p>\n<p>The causes of childhood pneumonia can vary by age. For example, pneumonia due to respiratory viruses,&nbsp;<em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>&nbsp;is more common in children under 5 years old.</p>\n<p>Pneumonia due to&nbsp;<em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em>&nbsp;is frequently observed in children between the ages of 5 and 13.&nbsp;<em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em>&nbsp;is one of the causes of walking pneumonia. It&rsquo;s a milder form of pneumonia.</p>\n<p>See your pediatrician if you notice your child:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>is having trouble breathing</li>\n<li>lacks energy</li>\n<li>has changes in appetite</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Pneumonia can become dangerous quickly, particularly in young children.&nbsp;<a>Here&rsquo;s how to avoid complications.</a></p>\n</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n<div><a ></a>Pneumonia home remedies</div>\n<p>Although home remedies don&rsquo;t actually treat pneumonia, there are some things you can do to help ease symptoms.</p>\n<p>Coughing is one of the most common symptoms of pneumonia. Natural ways to relieve a cough include gargling salt water or drinking peppermint tea.</p>\n<p>Things like OTC pain medication and cool compresses can work to relieve a fever. Drinking warm water or having a nice warm bowl of soup can help with chills.&nbsp;<a >Here are six more home remedies to try.</a></p>\n<p>Although home remedies can help ease symptoms, it&rsquo;s important to stick to your treatment plan. Take any prescribed medications as directed.</p>\n</div>\n<div >\n<div><a></a>Pneumonia recovery</div>\n<p>Most people respond to treatment and recover from pneumonia. Like your treatment, your recovery time will depend on the type of pneumonia you have, how severe it is, and your general health.</p>\n<p>A younger person may feel back to normal in a week after treatment. Others may take longer to recover and may have lingering fatigue. If your symptoms are severe, your recovery may take several weeks.</p>\n<p>Consider taking these steps to aid in your recovery and help prevent complications from occurring:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stick to the treatment plan your doctor has developed and take all medications as instructed.</li>\n<li>Make sure to get plenty of rest to help your body fight the infection.</li>\n<li>Drink plenty of fluids.</li>\n<li>Ask your doctor when you should schedule a follow-up appointment. They may want to perform another chest X-ray to make sure your infection has cleared.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div >&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>','Pneumonia','2023-07-09 11:05:43','2023-07-09 11:05:43',NULL),(27,26,NULL,'Depression','<h1>Depression:</h1>\n<h2>What is depression?</h2>\n<div >\n<p>Everyone has spells of feeling down, but depression is more than just spending a few days feeling sad or unhappy. Depression can make you feel persistently sad and down for weeks or months at a time.</p>\n<p>While some people believe that depression is trivial or not a genuine health problem, it\'s actually a real condition that affects around one in 10 people over the course of their lives. It impacts people of all genders and ages &ndash; including children. Studies show that around 4% of children in the UK between the ages of five and 16 are depressed or anxious.</p>\n<p>With the right support and treatment, most people recover fully from depression.</p>\n<h2>Do I have depression?</h2>\n<p>Depression has a range of different symptoms, and it can affect everybody differently. The symptoms include feeling very tearful, feeling hopelessness and sadness, and losing interest in things you enjoyed before. It\'s also common for people with depression to have symptoms of&nbsp;<a>anxiety</a>.</p>\n<p>Physical symptoms happen with depression too &ndash; these can include feeling tired all the time, getting poor sleep, losing your sex drive, losing your appetite, and feeling aches and pains.</p>\n<p>If the symptoms are mild, you might simply experience a persistent low mood. It\'s common to feel stressed, sad or anxious during difficult times in your life, and a low mood can get better after a short time, rather than being a symptom of depression.</p>\n<p>Learn more about low mood and depression&nbsp;<a>here</a>.</p>\n<p>Severe symptoms of depression can make people feel suicidal &ndash; as if life is no longer worth living. Read more about depression symptoms&nbsp;<a>here</a>.</p>\n<h2>Seeing a doctor about depression</h2>\n<p>Big changes in your life, like bereavement, losing a job, or even having a baby, can cause symptoms of depression. You\'re also more likely to experience depression if you have a family history of depression. However, it\'s also possible to become depressed without there being an obvious reason.</p>\n<h2>Symptoms and causes of depression</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Symptoms of depression can be very different from person to person. However, as a general rule, if you are depressed you feel hopeless, sad and lacking interest in things that used to make you feel happy.</p>\n<p>Depression symptoms are bad enough to interfere with work, social life and family life, and can persist for weeks or months.</p>\n<p>Doctors describe depression in one of three ways, depending on how serious it is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>mild depression &ndash; it has some impact on daily life</li>\n<li>moderate depression &ndash; it has a significant impact on your daily life</li>\n<li>severe depression &ndash; this makes it nearly impossible to get through your life day to day</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A few people with severe depression may have symptoms of&nbsp;<a>psychotic depression</a>.</p>\n<p>Below is a list of depression symptoms &ndash; it\'s unlikely that one person would have all of them.</p>\n<h3>Psychological depression symptoms include:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>continuous sadness or low mood</li>\n<li>losing interest in things</li>\n<li>losing motivation</li>\n<li>not getting any enjoyment in life</li>\n<li>feeling tearful</li>\n<li>feeling guilty</li>\n<li>feeling&nbsp;<a>anxious</a></li>\n<li>feeling irritable</li>\n<li>finding it hard to make decisions</li>\n<li>feeling intolerant of other people</li>\n<li>feeling helpless</li>\n<li>feeling hopeless</li>\n<li>low self-esteem</li>\n<li>feeling&nbsp;<a >worried</a></li>\n<li>thinking about&nbsp;<a>suicide</a></li>\n<li>thinking about harming yourself</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Physical symptoms include:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>speaking or moving slower than usual</li>\n<li>aches and pains that can\'t be explained</li>\n<li>losing, or sometimes gaining, appetite or weight</li>\n<li>constipation</li>\n<li>loss of interest in sex</li>\n<li>disturbed sleep (having trouble falling asleep, for example, or waking up very early)</li>\n<li>loss of energy</li>\n<li>changes in your menstrual cycle (the time of the month when you get your period)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Social symptoms are common too. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>avoiding talking to or spending time with your friends</li>\n<li>taking part in fewer social activities</li>\n<li>neglecting interests and hobbies</li>\n<li>doing poorly at work</li>\n<li>difficulties with your family or home life</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It\'s not always possible to tell that you\'re having symptoms of depression right away &ndash; it can start and progress gradually. A lot of people don\'t realise they\'re ill and try to carry on and cope with their symptoms. Sometimes it takes a friend or family member to notice that there\'s a problem.</p>\n<h2>Depression and grief</h2>\n<p>Depression and grief have a lot of the same features, and it can be hard to tell them apart. However, they\'re different in many important ways. Depression is an illness &ndash; grief is a completely natural response to loss.</p>\n<p>If you\'re grieving, you may find your feelings of sadness and loss come and go, but it\'s still possible to enjoy things in life and look forward to the future.</p>\n<p>People with depression feel sad persistently, find it difficult to be positive about the future, and don\'t get enjoyment from anything.</p>\n<p>Learn more about the differences between grief and depression&nbsp;<a>here</a>.</p>\n<h2>Different types of depression</h2>\n<p>There are different types of depression, and there are some conditions where depression is a symptom. These conditions include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a>Bipolar disorder</a>&nbsp;&ndash; people with bipolar disorder, which is also known as \"manic depression\", experience times of depression, where the symptoms are similar to clinical depression. They also go through phases when they have excessively high moods (known as \"mania\"). Bouts of mania can include harmful behaviour like unsafe sex, spending sprees and gambling.</li>\n<li><a>Seasonal affective disorder (SAD)</a>&nbsp;is also called \"winter depression\". It\'s depression that is related to weather, usually winter, so it happens seasonally.</li>\n<li><a>Postnatal depression</a>&nbsp;happens to some women after they\'ve had a baby. It\'s treated similarly to other types of depression, with antidepressant medication and talking therapy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Learn more about how depression is diagnosed&nbsp;<a>here</a>.</p>\n<h2>Causes of depression</h2>\n<p>Depression doesn\'t have one single cause &ndash; it can have a range of triggers, and there are many different reasons a person can develop the condition. Some people are affected after a stressful life event, like a bereavement or divorce. Other people experience depression related to illness, job loss, or money worries.</p>\n<p>Different reasons can combine and trigger depression. If you\'re feeling low after a job loss or health issues, and then experience something traumatic, like a bereavement, you can develop depression.</p>\n<p>It\'s common to hear about depression being brought on by a \"downward spiral\" &ndash; one thing causing other problems that combine to cause depression. For example, losing your job could make you feel sad, so you spend less time with family and friends and maybe drink more alcohol. These things all make you feel worse, which triggers depression.</p>\n<p>There are studies that suggest people are more likely to become depressed when they get older. There\'s also evidence that depression is more common for people whose economic and social circumstances are difficult.</p>\n<h3>Depression and illness</h3>\n<p>Long-lasting or life-threatening conditions like&nbsp;<a>cancer</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>coronary heart disease</a>&nbsp;can put you at higher risk of developing depression.</p>\n<p>Many people don\'t know that head injuries can cause depression, and a&nbsp;<a>severe head injury</a>&nbsp;can lead to emotional problems and mood swings.</p>\n<p>Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) can happen as a result of immune system problems. It\'s also possible, although rare, for a minor head injury to damage the pituitary gland. This is a gland the size of a pea which sits at the base of the brain and produces hormones that stimulate the thyroid. Damage to the pituitary gland can cause symptoms, including severe tiredness and a lack of interest in sex, which can then cause people to develop depression.</p>\n<h3>Depression and drugs and alcohol</h3>\n<p>\"Drowning your sorrows\" is actually a bad idea when it comes to depression. Alcohol is categorised as a \"strong depressant\" which can make depression worse, and drinking or taking drugs to cope can lead to a downward spiral by having a negative affect on other parts of your life.</p>\n<p>There\'s evidence that cannabis can cause depression, particularly in teenagers, even if it helps you relax.</p>\n<h3>Other causes of depression</h3>\n<p>There are a number of things that can lead to developing depression.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stressful events &ndash; big changes in your life, like bereavement, the end of a relationship or the loss of a job, can be difficult to deal with. When these things happen, it\'s important to keep seeing friends and family instead of trying to deal with problems alone &ndash; this increases your risk of developing depression.</li>\n<li>Giving birth &ndash; pregnancy and birth can make some people vulnerable to depression. Postnatal depression can happen as the result of physical changes, hormonal changes, and the responsibility of taking care of a new baby.</li>\n<li>Loneliness &ndash; your risk of depression gets higher if you aren\'t in contact or spending time with family and friends.</li>\n<li>Personality &ndash; some personality traits can put you at a higher risk of developing depression. These include low-self esteem or a habit of criticising yourself too much. These personality traits can come from your genes, which you get from your parents, or they can be as a result of experiences in your early life.</li>\n<li>Family history &ndash; it\'s more likely for someone to develop depression if a family member, like a sibling or parent, has experienced it before.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Diagnosing and treating depression</h2>\n<div>\n<p>There\'s no physical test for depression.</p>\n<p>If you experience depression symptoms most of the day, every day, for more than two weeks, you should visit your GP. This is especially important if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you have symptoms of depression that aren\'t getting any better</li>\n<li>you have thoughts of self-harm or&nbsp;<a>suicide</a></li>\n<li>your work, relationships with friends and family, or interests are affected by your mood</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It can be hard for people with depression to imagine that anything can help them &ndash; but the sooner you seek help, the sooner the symptoms start to get better.</p>\n<p>Your GP may examine you and perform blood or urine tests to make sure there isn\'t another condition causing your depression symptoms, like an&nbsp;<a>underactive thyroid</a>.</p>\n<p>When you see your GP, they\'ll try to find out if you have depression by asking you questions. These are likely to be about your health, how you\'re feeling, and how that is affecting you mentally and physically.</p>\n<p>Telling your doctor your symptoms and the affect they are having on you will help your GP to tell if you have depression, and how severe the condition is. It\'s important to be as open as possible.</p>\n<p>Your conversation with your GP will be confidential. This rule can only be broken if your GP thinks there is a significant risk of harm to you or others, and that telling a family member or carer would make that risk lower.</p>\n<h2>Treating depression</h2>\n<p>The first place to go is your GP &ndash; they will refer to you local talking treatments for depression that are available on the NHS.</p>\n<p>You may also have the option to self-refer, depending on where you live, so you can go directly to a professional therapist if you\'d rather not talk to your GP.</p>\n<h2>Talking treatments for depression</h2>\n<p>There are a number of talking therapies for depression.</p>\n<h3>Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)</h3>\n<p>CBT helps you make sense of your thoughts and behaviour and the affect they have on you. Part of it\'s recognising that past events may have played a part in making you who you are, but the main focus is changing how you feel, behave and think now.</p>\n<p>You can use CBT to learn how to overcome negative thoughts &ndash; this can help you to tackle feelings of hopelessness, for example.</p>\n<p>Most people have a course of six to eight CBT sessions that goes over 10 to 12 weeks. Sessions are one-to-one, between you and a CBT-trained counsellor. You might also be offered group CBT.</p>\n<h3>Computerised CBT (CCBT)</h3>\n<p>This type of CBT is done using a computer instead of face-to-face with the counsellor. It should be supported by a healthcare professional &ndash; your GP may prescribe it, and you might have to use the computer in the GP surgery to access it. CCBT involves a series of weekly sessions.</p>\n<h3>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</h3>\n<p>IPT is focused on your relationships with people around you, and problems that you might be having with them. These can include problems communicating, or dealing with a bereavement.</p>\n<p>There\'s evidence that suggests IPT can be as effective for depression as CBT or medication, but more research needs to be done.</p>\n<h3>Psychodynamic psychotherapy</h3>\n<p>This is also known as psychoanalytic psychotherapy. You\'ll work with a therapist who encourages you to say whatever you\'re thinking. This helps you to find hidden patterns and meanings in your words and behaviour that could be contributing to your depression.</p>\n<p>Read more about psychotherapy&nbsp;<a>here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Counselling</h3>\n<p>Counselling is a type of therapy that works really well if you have good mental wellbeing overall but need help coping with a crisis that\'s currently going on in your life. These can include anger, bereavement, infertility, relationship problems, job loss and serious illness.</p>\n<p>On the NHS, counselling usually takes place over six to 12 sessions, each an hour long. The sessions are confidential.</p>\n<p>A counsellor helps you to think about what\'s going on in your life and find new ways of dealing with the problems. They\'ll offer practical advice, support you, and help you find solutions, but they don\'t tell you what to do.</p>\n<h2>Antidepressants</h2>\n<p><a>Antidepressants</a>&nbsp;are medicines that treat depression symptoms. There are almost 30 different types of antidepressant that can be prescribed to you.</p>\n<p>Most people who have moderate or severe depression notice improvement when they take antidepressants, but this isn\'t the case for everyone. One type of antidepressant might not work for you, but another one could. It can take two or more different treatments to find the right one for you.</p>\n<p>Side effects vary between different people and different antidepressants, but the different types of antidepressant all work around as well as each other.</p>\n<p>If you\'re prescribed antidepressants, you should see your GP or specialist nurse regularly while you first start taking the medication &ndash; every week or two for at least four weeks. This is so your treatment provider can see how the antidepressants are working.</p>\n<p>If the medication is working for you, you should continue taking them at the same dose for at least four to six months after the depression symptoms have eased. People who have had depression in the past might have to take antidepressants for up to five years, maybe longer.</p>\n<p>Antidepressants aren\'t addictive. However, you might have withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking them suddenly or miss a dose. You can read more about withdrawal symptoms below.</p>\n<h3>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</h3>\n<p>If your GP thinks you would benefit from taking an antidepressant, you\'ll usually be prescribed a modern type called a&nbsp;<a>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)</a>. Examples of commonly used SSRI antidepressants are Seroxat (paroxetine), Prozac (fluoxetine) and Cipramil (citalopram).</p>\n<p>They help increase the level of a natural chemical in your brain called serotonin, which is thought to be a \"good mood\" chemical.</p>\n<p>SSRIs work just as well as older antidepressants and have fewer side effects.</p>\n<p>They can, however, cause nausea and headaches, as well as a dry mouth and problems having sex. However, all these negative effects usually improve over time.</p>\n<p>Some SSRIs aren\'t suitable for children under the age of 18. Research shows that the risk of&nbsp;<a>self-harm</a>&nbsp;and suicidal behaviour may increase if they\'re taken by under-18s. Fluoxetine is the only SSRI that can be prescribed for under-18s, and even then only when a specialist has given the go-ahead.</p>\n<h3>Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)</h3>\n<p>This group of antidepressants is used to treat moderate to severe depression.</p>\n<p>TCAs, which includes Imipramil (imipramine) and amitriptyline, have been around for longer than SSRIs.</p>\n<p>They work by raising the levels of the chemicals serotonin and noradrenaline in your brain. These both help lift your mood.</p>\n<p>They\'re generally quite safe, but it\'s a bad idea to smoke cannabis if you are taking TCAs because it can cause your heart to beat rapidly.</p>\n<p>Side effects of TCAs may include a dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, problems passing urine, sweating, light-headedness and excessive drowsiness, but vary from person to person.</p>\n<p>The side effects usually ease after seven to 10 days, as your body gets used to the medication.</p>\n<h3>Other antidepressants</h3>\n<p>New antidepressants, such as Efexor (venlafaxine), Cymbalta or Yentreve (duloxetine) and Zispin Soltab (mirtazapine), work in a slightly different way from SSRIs and TCAs.</p>\n<p>Venlafaxine and duloxetine are known as SNRIs (serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors). Like TCAs, they change the levels of serotonin and noradrenaline in your brain.</p>\n<p>Studies have shown that an SNRI can be more effective than an SSRI, though they\'re not routinely prescribed as they can lead to a rise in blood pressure.</p>\n<h3>Withdrawal symptoms</h3>\n<p>Antidepressants are not addictive in the same way that illegal drugs and cigarettes are, but when you stop taking them you may have some withdrawal symptoms, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>upset stomach</li>\n<li>flu-like symptoms</li>\n<li>anxiety</li>\n<li>dizziness</li>\n<li>vivid dreams at night</li>\n<li>sensations in the body that feel like electric shocks</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In most cases these are quite mild and last no longer than a week or two, but occasionally they can be quite severe. They seem to be most likely to occur with paroxetine (Seroxat) and venlafaxine (Efexor).</p>\n<p>Withdrawal symptoms occur very soon after stopping the tablets, so can easily be told apart from symptoms of depression relapse, which tend to occur after a few weeks.</p>\n<h2>Other treatments for depression</h2>\n<p>There is a range of other treatments that people are given for depression.</p>\n<h3>St John\'s Wort</h3>\n<p>St John\'s Wort is a herbal treatment that you can buy from pharmacies and health food shops. Some people take it for depression. There\'s some evidence that it can help the symptoms of mild-to-moderate depression, but doctors don\'t recommend St John\'s Wort because the amount of active ingredients change depending on the brand and batch. This means that you can never be sure what kind of effect it will have.</p>\n<p>If you take St John\'s Wort with other medications, like anticonvulsants, anticoagulants, antidepressants and the contraceptive pill, it can cause serious problems. St John\'s Wort can interact with the contraceptive pill and reduce its effectiveness at preventing pregnancy.</p>\n<p>You shouldn\'t take St John\'s Wort while pregnant or breastfeeding, as we can\'t be certain that it\'s safe.</p>\n<h3>Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) &ndash; electric shock treatment</h3>\n<p>If you have severe depression and other treatments, like medication, haven\'t worked, ECT might be recommended for you.</p>\n<p>When receiving ECT, you will be given an anaesthetic and medication that relaxes your muscles to begin with. Electrodes will be placed on your head that give an electrical \"shock\" to your brain.</p>\n<p>ECT is given over a series of sessions, normally twice a week for three to six weeks.</p>\n<p>ECT can cause side effects including nausea, headaches, aches in the muscles and memory problems.</p>\n<p>Most people find that ECT is good for relieving severe depression, but the beneficial effects tend to wear off when several months have passed.</p>\n<h3>Lithium</h3>\n<p>If you\'ve tried several different antidepressants and had no improvement, your doctor may offer you a type of medication called lithium in addition to your current treatment.</p>\n<p>There are two types of lithium: lithium carbonate and lithium citrate. Both are usually effective, but if you\'re taking one that works for you, it\'s best not to change.</p>\n<p>If the level of lithium in your blood becomes too high, it can become toxic. You\'ll therefore need blood tests every three months to check your lithium levels while you\'re on the medication.</p>\n<p>You\'ll also need to avoid eating a low-salt diet because this can also cause the lithium to become toxic. Ask your GP for advice about your diet.</p>\n<h2>Living with depression</h2>\n<div>\n<p>There\'s a lot of advice available for living with depression and feeling better.</p>\n<h2>Talking about depression</h2>\n<p>You can find support and insight by talking about depression with another person or a group. According to research, talking can help you to recover and deal better with stress.</p>\n<p>If you don\'t feel comfortable talking about your symptoms and feelings with other people, you can write about how you feel or use poetry or art to express yourself &ndash; doing this can also help you to feel better.</p>\n<h3>Smoking, drugs, alcohol and depression</h3>\n<p>It might feel like cigarettes and alcohol are helpful, but in the long run they can make you feel worse.</p>\n<p>If you have depression it\'s especially important to be careful when it comes to cannabis. Research has shown there\'s a strong connection between mental health problems and cannabis use.</p>\n<p>According to the evidence, if you smoke cannabis while dealing with depression:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>your symptoms get worse</li>\n<li>you feel less interested in things</li>\n<li>you\'re more likely to have earlier and more frequent relapses of depression</li>\n<li>you\'re less likely to recover fully from depression</li>\n<li>you feel more tired</li>\n<li>you won\'t respond as well to antidepressants</li>\n<li>you\'re more likely to stop taking antidepressants</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can get advice and support from your GP on cutting down or stopping drinking, smoking, and drug use.</p>\n<p>Learn more about stopping smoking&nbsp;<a>here</a></p>\n<p>Learn more about help to cut down or stop drinking alcohol&nbsp;<a>here</a></p>\n<h2>Work, money, and depression</h2>\n<p>You might need to take time off work if your depression is caused by working too much, or if the symptoms are making it hard for you to do your job. However, research has shown that taking a long time off work can make depression worse, and that going back to work can help you to get better.</p>\n<p>When you\'re dealing with depression it\'s important to avoid as much stress, work-related and otherwise, as you can. If you\'re working you might be able to change to shorter hours, or work more flexibly. This is especially true if pressure at work causes you to experience depression symptoms.</p>\n<p>The Equality Act means that employers need to make reasonable adjustments to make it possible to employ people with disabilities &ndash; this can include people who have been diagnosed with depression and other mental health conditions.</p>\n<p>You can find more information about dealing with stress at work&nbsp;<a>here</a>.</p>\n<p>If your depression means you are unable to work, there are benefits you may be eligible to claim. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a>Attendance Allowance</a></li>\n<li><a>Carer\'s Allowance</a></li>\n<li><a>Council Tax Benefit</a></li>\n<li><a>Personal Independence Payment (PIP)</a></li>\n<li><a>Housing Benefit</a></li>\n<li><a>Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)</a></li>\n<li><a>Statutory Sick Pay</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bereavement and depression</h2>\n<p>Your depression can be triggered by losing someone who is close to you. The emotional blow suffered when a person you care about dies is powerful &ndash; it might feel like you will never recover from the loss.</p>\n<p>Along with time, the right help and support can make it possible to start living your life again. Find out more about coping with a bereavement&nbsp;<a>here</a>.</p>\n<h2>Looking after someone who has depression</h2>\n<p>If you\'re close to someone with depression, their condition can affect you too. Your relationship, and family life in general, can be strained, and you might not know what to do or how to help.</p>\n<p>Talking about the situation can help. Finding a support group, or talking to other people in a similar situation, can make it easier to cope. If the condition is causing difficulties in your relationship with your partner, you could contact a relationship counsellor who can talk things through with both of you.</p>\n<p>When suffering from depression, men are less likely to ask for help than women. They\'re also more likely to turn to drugs and alcohol to cope with the symptoms.</p>\n<h2>Depression and suicide</h2>\n<p>The majority of suicide cases are linked with mental disorders, and most of them are triggered by severe depression.</p>\n<p>Warning signs that someone with depression may be considering suicide are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>making final arrangements, like giving away their things, making a will or saying goodbye to friends</li>\n<li>talking about death or suicide &ndash; this may be with direct statements, like \"I wish I was dead\", but often depressed people talk about the subject indirectly, saying things like: \"I think dead people must be happier than us\" or \"wouldn\'t it be nice to go to sleep and never wake up\"</li>\n<li>self-harm, like cutting their arms or legs, or burning themselves with cigarettes</li>\n<li>a sudden lifting of mood, which could mean that a person has decided to commit suicide and feels better because of this decision</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you\'re feeling suicidal or are in a crisis of depression, contact your GP as soon as possible.

We would rather not talk about it. We hope it will never happen to anyone we know. But suicide is a reality, and it is more common than you might think. The possibility that suicide could claim the life of someone you love cannot be ignored. By paying attention to warning signs and talking about the &lsquo;unthinkable,&rsquo; you may be able to prevent a death.</p>\n<p><strong>Who is at risk?</strong></p>\n<p>People likely to die by suicide include those who:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>are having a serious physical or mental illness,</li>\n<li>are abusing alcohol or drugs,</li>\n<li>are experiencing a major loss, such as the death of a loved one, unemployment or divorce,</li>\n<li>are experiencing major changes in their life, such as teenagers and seniors,</li>\n<li>have made previous suicide threats.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why do people choose suicide?</strong></p>\n<p>There are many circumstances which can contribute to someone&rsquo;s decision to end his/her life, but a person&rsquo;s feelings about those circumstances are more important than the circumstances themselves. All people who consider suicide feel that life is unbearable. They have an extreme sense of hopelessness, helplessness, and desperation. With some types of mental illness, people may hear voices or have delusions which prompt them to kill themselves.</p>\n<p>People who talk about dying by suicide or make an attempt do not necessarily want to die. Often, they are reaching out for help. Sometimes, a suicide attempt becomes the turning point in a person&rsquo;s life if there is enough support to help him/her make necessary changes.</p>\n<p>If someone you know is feeling desperate enough to attempt suicide, you may be able to help him/her find a better way to cope. If you yourself are so distressed that you cannot think of any way out except by &lsquo;ending it all,&rsquo; remember, help for your problems is available.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the warning signs?</strong></p>\n<p>Suicide is rarely a spur of the moment decision. In the days and hours before people attempt suicide, there are usually clues and warning signs.</p>\n<p>The strongest and most concerning signs are often verbal &ndash; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go on,&rdquo; &ldquo;Nothing matters any more&rdquo; or even &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking of ending it all.&rdquo; Such remarks should always be taken seriously.</p>\n<p>And remember that most people who are considering suicide have lost hope and are trying to find a way out of the inner pain and suffering they are experiencing.</p>\n<p>Some warning signs that a person may be suicidal include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>repeated expressions of hopelessness, helplessness, or desperation,</li>\n<li>withdrawal from friends and activities,</li>\n<li>feeling marginalized, rejected,</li>\n<li>behaviour that is out of character, such as recklessness in someone who is normally careful,</li>\n<li>loss of interest in usual activities,</li>\n<li>decrease in appetite or increased use of alcohol and other drugs,</li>\n<li>recent death of a friend or family member,</li>\n<li>job loss, failing academic performance,</li>\n<li>talking about death or wanting to die, e.g. &ldquo;no one cares if I live or die&rdquo;</li>\n<li>mood swings, emotional outbursts, high level of irritability or aggression,</li>\n<li>a sudden and unexpected change to a cheerful attitude,</li>\n<li>giving away prized possessions to friends and family,</li>\n<li>making a will, taking out insurance, or other preparations for death, such as telling final wishes to someone close,</li>\n<li>making remarks related to death and dying, or an expressed intent to commit suicide.</li>\n<li>Previous suicidal behaviour</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember, there is no ultimate list of warning signs. It may be right to be concerned about someone simply because their behaviour is out of character. Sudden shifts in a person&rsquo;s attitude or actions can alert friends to potential problems.</p>\n<h3><strong><u>Thinking about Suicide?</u></strong></h3>\n<p><strong>What can you do if you are feeling suicidal?</strong></p>\n<p>The beginning of the way out is to let someone else in. This is very hard to do because, if you feel so desperate that suicide seems to be the only solution, you are likely very frightened and ashamed. There is no reason to be ashamed of feeling suicidal and no reason to feel ashamed for seeking help. You are not alone; many people have felt suicidal when facing difficult times and have survived, usually returning to quite normal lives.</p>\n<p>Take the risk of telling your feelings to someone you know and trust: a relative, friend, social service worker, or a member of the clergy for your religion. There are many ways to cope and get support. The sense of desperation and the wish to die will not go away at once, but it will pass. Regaining your will to live is more important than anything else at the moment.</p>\n<p>Some things that you can do are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>call a&nbsp;<a><strong>Crisis</strong></a>&nbsp;telephone support line,</li>\n<li>draw on the support of family and friends,</li>\n<li>talk to your family doctor; he/she can refer you to services in the community, including counselling and hospital services,</li>\n<li>set up frequent appointments with a mental health professional, and request telephone support between appointments, &middot; get involved in self-help groups,</li>\n<li>talk every day to at least one person you trust about how you are feeling,</li>\n<li>think about seeking help from the emergency department of a local hospital,</li>\n<li>talk to someone who has &lsquo;been there&rsquo; about what it was like and how he/she coped,</li>\n<li>avoid making major decisions which you may later regret.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><a><strong>Losing Someone to Suicide</strong></a></p>\n<p>The death of someone close to us is one of life&rsquo;s most stressful events. When the death is from suicide, family and friends must cope with sadness at the loss plus all their feelings of confusion and sometimes even anger. It takes time to heal and each of us responds differently. We may need help to cope with the changes in our lives. But in the end, coping effectively with bereavement is vital to our mental health.</p>\n<p><strong>How common is suicide?</strong></p>\n<p>Approximately one out of four people knows someone who has died by suicide. The deceased leaves behind a network of family and close friends who must cope with the same inner turmoil that you are probably trying to understand and cope with now.</p>\n<p><strong>Am I to blame? Could I have helped?</strong></p>\n<p>No, you are not to blame. After a suicide, family members and friends often go over the pre-death circumstances and events, blaming themselves for things they think they should or should not have done. &lsquo;If only I had persuaded him to get help!&rsquo; or &lsquo;If only I hadn&rsquo;t told her I wanted a separation&hellip;&rsquo; Even though suicide is an individual decision, it is a very natural and common reaction for survivors to feel guilt or responsibility. People who are left behind should seek out bereavement counselling or support groups to help relieve this feeling of responsibility.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the stages of grieving?</strong></p>\n<p>There are many different stages of grieving. The three stages outlined below are ones which most people will experience. However, people do not usually flow from the first stage through to the last in a logical order. Some people may jump back and forth between stages, and the length of time it takes to go through the different stages may vary.</p>\n<p>Stage I &ndash; Numbness or Shock<br />Initially, people function almost mechanically. You may also feel anger, confusion or even relief depending on the circumstances. These feelings are normal. Many people at this stage will keep an emotional distance from others to protect themselves and to avoid discussing the death.</p>\n<p>Stage II &ndash; Disorganization<br />It is normal to feel lonely, depressed and tearful at this point. You may have problems sleeping or eating. Some people may feel sorry for themselves and even hallucinate. You may agonize over things you think you could have done for the deceased. At this stage, you may need to reach out to someone and discuss your feelings.</p>\n<p>Stage III &ndash; Re-organization<br />You will begin to feel more comfortable and may find that there are moments in your day when you do not think about your loss. Your feelings will not be as intense and you will be able to focus on daily tasks. At this point, most people need encouragement to re-enter life&rsquo;s mainstream.</p>\n<p>But remember, there is hope and help. You may never get over the death itself, but you will overcome the grief.</p>\n<p><strong>Is anger or relief a natural reaction?</strong></p>\n<p>While all kinds of loss are painful, the issues are different when dealing with a death by suicide. The length of time it takes to work through the stages of grief also varies depending on the circumstances.</p>\n<p>Feelings of anger, confusion and relief are natural. Do not deny them. If the deceased person had been depressed and/or had previously attempted suicide, there is nothing wrong in feeling relieved that the burden is gone or that you are angry because you have another burden to carry.</p>\n<p>If you do not work through these feelings, you will prevent yourself from moving forward in the bereavement process. Not moving forward is dangerous; it can cause mental and physical illness and can tear families and friendships apart. It can stop people from coming to terms with the suicide. You must face your feelings before you can work them out.</p>\n<p><strong>How does suicide affect the family?</strong></p>\n<p>It is important to realize that not all members of the family will grieve in the same way or go through the same stages at the same time. Every family member needs room and understanding to go through the bereavement process in his/her own way.</p>\n<p>Be honest with children about the cause of death. Otherwise, they will go through the grieving process again when they learn the truth. Be careful not to ignore or forget the grief experienced by children. They need help dealing with it but should not be &lsquo;protected&rsquo; from it.</p>\n<p><strong>How will my friends react?</strong></p>\n<p>Generally friends are well meaning. They want to give support and help but they may not know how. They may be afraid that they will overwhelm you or think that you want to be alone.</p>\n<p>Guide them. Tell your friends you want and need to talk about your loss. By opening up, you will help yourself and help your friends help you. People who talk out their feelings are usually the people who recover most quickly from a loss by suicide.</p>\n<p>If your friends seem uncomfortable talking about the death, or even being with you, it may be a reaction to your discomfort. If you are uncomfortable talking about the circumstances, don&rsquo;t. Your friends will already know. Let others simply respond to the death of your loved one.</p>\n<p><strong>As a friend, what should I do?</strong></p>\n<p>Try to understand and be patient with a grieving friend. Do not ignore or overwhelm a person who has suffered a suicide in the family. NEVER BLAME ANYONE. Suicide is a decision made by one person, and judgements should not be made about the family.</p>\n<p>Do not try to accelerate the process of bereavement. It can take a long time for a person to work through the grief, to deal with the confusion and to come to terms with his/her feelings.</p>\n<p>Treat your friend as you would treat anyone who has lost a family member. Be available to listen or to help out with the chores.</p>\n<p>Encourage your friend to consider outside help from a counselling agency or support group in the community. In a Suicide Bereavement Group or similar self-help group, your friend will be able to discuss his/her mixture of feelings with other people who have suffered a similar loss.</p>\n<p>Acknowledge your friend&rsquo;s feelings of guilt; it will help him/her to come to terms with the fact that he/she is not to blame.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you need more help?</strong></p>\n<p>If you are bereaved and feel you need more assistance than friends and family can provide, contact a community organization that can help you find additional support.</p>\n<h3><strong><u>When someone is at risk of suicide</u></strong></h3>\n<p>If you are concerned that someone may be suicidal, take action. You cannot prevent them from considering suicide, but you can help them to reconsider and seek other solutions. If possible, talk with the person directly. The single-most important thing you can do is listen attentively without judgement.</p>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to mention the topic of suicide. Talking about it will not increase the likelihood that someone will act on suicidal feelings. There is almost no risk that raising the topic with someone who is not considering suicide will prompt him/her to do it.</p>\n<p>Find a safe place to talk with the person, and allow as much time as necessary. Assure him/her of your concern and your respect for his/her privacy. Ask the person about recent events, and encourage him/her to express his/her feelings freely. Do not minimize the feelings involved.</p>\n<p>Ask whether the person feels desperate enough to consider suicide. If the answer is yes, ask, &lsquo;Do you have a plan? How and where do you intend to end your life?&rsquo;</p>\n<p>Admit your own concern and fear if the person tells you that he/she is thinking about suicide but do not react by saying, &lsquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t be having these thoughts; things can&rsquo;t be that bad.&rsquo; Remember, you are being trusted with someone&rsquo;s deepest feelings. Although it may upset you, talking about those feeling will bring the person relief.</p>\n<p>Ask if there is anything you can do. Talk about resources that can be drawn on (family, friends, community agencies, crisis centres) to provide support, practical assistance, counselling or treatment.</p>\n<p>Make a plan with the person for the next few hours or days. Make contacts with him/her or on his/her behalf. If possible, go with the person to get help.</p>\n<p>Let the person know when you can be available, and then make sure you are available at those times. Also, make sure your limits are known, and try to arrange that there is always someone that he/she can call at any time of day.</p>\n<p>Ask who else knows about the suicidal feelings. Are there other people who should know? Is the person willing to tell them? Unfortunately, not everyone will treat this issue sensitively. Confidentiality is important, but do not keep the situation secret if a life is clearly in danger.</p>\n<p>Stay in touch to see how he/she is doing. Praise the person for having the courage to trust you and for continuing to live and struggle. And remember that no one can solve another person&rsquo;s problems, but understanding and support can help.</p>\n<p><strong>What to do following a suicide attempt</strong></p>\n<p>A person may try to attempt suicide without warning or despite efforts to help. If you are involved in giving first aid, make every effort to be calm and reassuring, and get medical help immediately.</p>\n<p>The time following an attempt is critical. The person should receive intensive care during this time. Maintain regular contact, and work with the person to organize support. It is vital that he/she does not feel cut off or shunned as a result of attempting suicide.</p>\n<p>Be aware that, if someone is intent on dying, you may not be able to stop it from happening. You cannot and should not carry the responsibility for someone else&rsquo;s choice.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong><u>Youth and Suicide</u></strong></h3>\n<p>Youth are among the highest risk populations for suicide. In Canada, suicide accounts for 24 percent of all deaths among 15-24 year olds and 16 percent among 16-44 year olds. Suicide is the second leading cause of death for Canadians between the ages of 10 and 24.</p>\n<p>Adolescence is a time of dramatic change. The journey from child to adult can be complex and challenging. Young people often feel tremendous pressure to succeed at school, at home and in social groups. At the same time, they may lack the life experience that lets them know that difficult situations will not last forever. Mental health problems commonly associated with adults, such as depression, also affect young people. Any one of these factors, or a combination, may become such a source of pain that they seek relief in suicide. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among young people after motor vehicle accidents. Yet people are often reluctant to discuss it. This is partly due to the stigma, guilt or shame that surrounds suicide. People are often uncomfortable discussing it. Unfortunately, this tradition of silence perpetuates harmful myths and attitudes. It can also prevent people from talking openly about the pain they feel or the help they need.</p>\n<p>Suicide can appear to be an impulsive act. But it&rsquo;s a complicated process, and a person may think about it for some time before taking action. It&rsquo;s estimated that 8 out of 10 people who attempt suicide or die by suicide hinted about or made some mention of their plans. Often, those warning signs are directed at a friend.</p>\n<p>Recognizing the warning signs is one thing; knowing what to do with that information is another. Suicide was a taboo subject for a very long time. Even talking about it is still difficult for most people. But being able to talk about suicide can help save a life. Learning about suicide is the first step in the communication process. Suicide is about escape. Someone who thinks seriously about suicide is experiencing pain that is so crushing, they feel that only death will stop it.</p>\n<p><strong>Some myths about youth suicide</strong></p>\n<p>Myth:&nbsp;Young people rarely think about suicide.<br />Reality:&nbsp;Teens and suicide are more closely linked than adults might expect. In a survey of 15,000 grade 7 to 12 students in British Columbia, 34% knew of someone who had attempted or died by suicide; 16% had seriously considered suicide; 14% had made a suicide plan; 7% had made an attempt and 2% had required medical attention due to an attempt.</p>\n<p>Myth:&nbsp;Talking about suicide will give a young person the idea, or permission, to consider suicide as a solution to their problems.<br />Reality:&nbsp;Talking calmly about suicide, without showing fear or making judgments, can bring relief to someone who is feeling terribly isolated. A willingness to listen shows sincere concern; encouraging someone to speak about their suicidal feelings can reduce the risk of an attempt.</p>\n<p>Myth:&nbsp;Suicide is sudden and unpredictable.<br />Reality:&nbsp;Suicide is most often a process, not an event. Eight out of ten people who die by suicide gave some, or even many, indications of their intentions.</p>\n<p>Myth:&nbsp;Suicidal youth are only seeking attention or trying to manipulate others.<br />Reality:&nbsp;Efforts to manipulate or grab attention are always a cause for concern. It is difficult to determine if a youth is at risk of suicide All suicide threats must be taken seriously.</p>\n<p>Myth:&nbsp;Suicidal people are determined to die.<br />Reality:&nbsp;Suicidal youth are in pain. They don&rsquo;t necessarily want to die; they want their pain to end. If their ability to cope is stretched to the limit, or if problems occur together with a mental illness, it can seem that death is the only way to make the pain stop.</p>\n<p>Myth:&nbsp;A suicidal person will always be at risk.<br />Reality:&nbsp;Most people feel suicidal at some time in their lives. The overwhelming desire to escape from pain can be relieved when the problem or pressure is relieved. Learning effective coping techniques to deal with stressful situations can help.</p>\n<p><a><strong>Suicide: Responsible Media Reporting Guidelines</strong></a></p>\n<p>Certain ways of presenting and portraying suicide in the media appear to precipitate suicidal behaviour in vulnerable people. This evidence has led many countries to develop media guidelines for reporting and portraying suicide.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid presenting simplistic explanations for suicide.</strong>&nbsp;Suicide usually results from a complex set of circumstances and is seldom the result of a single event such as the loss of a job or the end of a relationship.</p>\n<p><strong>Do not engage in repetitive, prominent, or excessive reporting of suicide.</strong>&nbsp;This may promote and maintain a preoccupation with suicide among at-risk individuals. For example, suicide reports should be located on an inside page of a newspaper, never as a front-page headline.</p>\n<p><strong>Be careful not to sensationalize coverage.</strong>&nbsp;Sensational news coverage of a suicide tends to heighten the general public&rsquo;s preoccupation with suicide, particularly when a celebrity is involved. For example, sensational coverage can be minimized by avoiding the use of dramatic photographs.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid &ldquo;how-to&rdquo; descriptions of suicide.</strong>&nbsp;It is also thought that technical details about the method of suicide used in a particular incidence may provide a vulnerable person with the knowledge they need to imitate the actions of the victim.</p>\n<p><strong>Do not position a suicide as a means to solve problems.</strong>&nbsp;Presenting suicide as a means of dealing with personal problems may suggest that suicide is an acceptable coping strategy.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid glorifying the incident or the victim.</strong>&nbsp;Prominent coverage of community expressions of grief (e.g., eulogies, memorials, flags at half-mast) may suggest that society is honouring the suicidal behaviour of the victim, rather than mourning the person&rsquo;s death.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid overemphasizing the victim&rsquo;s positive characteristics.</strong>&nbsp;It is important to note the victim&rsquo;s problems in addition to the positive aspects of his or her life in order to decrease the attractiveness of the suicidal behaviour, especially for individuals who rarely receive positive reinforcement.</p>\n<p><strong>Treat survivors with sensitivity and respect their privacy.</strong>&nbsp;Immediately following a death by suicide, grieving family members and friends are in shock, have difficulty understanding what happened, and may be at heightened risk of suicide themselves. Care and consideration should always be shown when interviewing close family and friends of the victim.</p>\n<p><strong>Provide information that increases public awareness.</strong>&nbsp;Enhancing general public awareness about suicide risk factors, warning signs, and possible actions to assist a suicidal person can help friends and family members recognize suicidal risk in a vulnerable person.</p>\n<p><strong>List available community resources.</strong>&nbsp;Information on available resources (help lines, crisis services, and clinical services) with up-to-date contact information should always be included in media stories dealing with suicide.</p>\n<p><strong>Feature stories about people who adopted life-affirming options.</strong>&nbsp;Stories that present positive ways of coping and positive roles models can help prevent further suicide attempts.</p>\n<p><a><strong>Survivor Support Services</strong></a></p>\n<p>If you feel you need more support than family or friends can provide, contact your doctor or counseling agency in your area. Other resources can include spiritual communities, crisis lines and bereavement support groups.</p>\n</div>\n<p>If you feel there is an immediate danger, stay with the person or have someone else stay with them, and remove all available means of committing suicide, such as medication.</p>\n<p>Over-the-counter drugs such as painkillers can be just as dangerous as prescription medication.</p>\n<p>Also, remove sharp objects and poisonous household chemicals such as bleach.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>','Thinking','2023-07-09 11:05:43','2023-07-09 11:05:43',NULL),(29,28,NULL,'Self-harm','<h1>Self-harm:</h1>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<div >\n<p>Self-harm is when somebody intentionally damages or injures their body. It is a way of expressing deep emotional feelings such as low self-esteem, or a way of coping with traumatic events, such as the death of a loved one.</p>\n<p>If you are self-harming, you should see your GP for help.

For example, they may cover up their skin and avoid discussing the problem. It may, therefore, be up to close family and friends to notice when somebody is self-harming, and to approach the subject with care and understanding. The signs may include unexplained injuries and signs of depression or low-self esteem.</p>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;<a>the signs of self-harm</a></p>\n<p>Someone who is self-harming can seriously hurt themselves, so it is important that they speak to a GP about the underlying issue and about any treatment or therapy that might help them.</p>\n<h2>Signs</h2>\n<div>\n<p>There are many different forms of self-harm and they are not always easy to notice.</p>\n<p>People who self-harm usually try to keep it a secret from their friends and family and often injure themselves in places that can be hidden easily by clothing.</p>\n<p>If you suspect that a friend or relative is self-harming, look out for any of the following signs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>unexplained cuts, bruises or cigarette burns, usually on their wrists, arms, thighs and chest</li>\n<li>keeping themselves fully covered at all times, even in hot weather</li>\n<li>signs of&nbsp;<a>depression</a>, such as low mood, tearfulness or a lack of motivation or interest in anything</li>\n<li>changes in eating habits or being secretive about eating, and any unusual weight loss or weight gain</li>\n<li>signs of low self-esteem, such as blaming themselves for any problems or thinking they are not good enough for something</li>\n<li>signs they have been pulling out their hair</li>\n<li>signs of&nbsp;<a>alcohol or drug misuse</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The person who is self-harming may feel deep shame and guilt, or may feel confused and worried by their own behaviour. It&rsquo;s important to approach them with care and understanding.</p>\n<p>They may not wish to discuss their self-harm with you, but you could suggest that they speak to an anonymous helpline or see their GP.</p>\n<h2>Causes</h2>\n<div>\n<p>There are many reasons why people self-harm, but the causes usually stem from unhappy emotions.</p>\n<p>Self-harming has been described as a \"physical expression of emotional distress\". If somebody is feeling overwhelmed with unhappy emotions, they may find that the physical act of hurting themselves makes them feel better.</p>\n<p>If you are feeling like this, you can speak to your GP, contact&nbsp;<a>Breathing Space</a>&nbsp;or call the&nbsp;<a>Samaritans</a>&nbsp;on 116 123 for support.</p>\n<h3>Social factors and trauma</h3>\n<p>Research has shown that social factors commonly cause emotional distress in people who self-harm. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>difficult relationships with friends or partners</li>\n<li>difficulties at school, such as not doing well academically</li>\n<li>difficulties at work</li>\n<li>being bullied, either at home, school or work</li>\n<li>worries about money</li>\n<li><a>alcohol or drug misuse</a></li>\n<li>coming to terms with your sexuality if you think you might be gay or bisexual</li>\n<li>coping with cultural expectations, for example, an arranged marriage</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Self-harm could also sometimes be a way of coping with a traumatic experience. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sexual, physical or emotional abuse, including domestic abuse and rape</li>\n<li>the death of a close family member or friend</li>\n<li>having a miscarriage</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Emotional distress</h3>\n<p>The distress from a traumatic experience or an unhappy situation can lead to feelings of low self-esteem or self-hatred. You could also have feelings of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>anger</li>\n<li>guilt</li>\n<li><a>anxiety</a></li>\n<li>loneliness</li>\n<li>grief</li>\n<li>numbness or emptiness</li>\n<li>feeling unconnected to the world</li>\n<li>being unclean, unworthy, trapped or silenced if you have been abused</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The emotions can gradually build up inside you, and you may not know who to turn to for help. Self-harm may be a way of releasing these pent-up feelings and finding a way to cope with your problems. It is not usually an attempt to seek attention, but a sign of emotional distress.</p>\n<p>Some research has suggested that people who self-harm may have difficulty managing or \"regulating\" their emotions. They use self-harm as a way of managing tension and anger. Research has also shown that people who self-harm are poorer at problem solving.</p>\n<p>Self-harm is linked to anxiety and depression. These mental health conditions can affect people of any age. Self-harm can also occur alongside antisocial behaviour, such as misbehaving at school or getting into trouble with the police.</p>\n<h3>Psychological causes</h3>\n<p>In some cases there may be a psychological reason for the self-harming (where the cause is related to an issue with your mind). For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you may hear voices telling you to self-harm</li>\n<li>you may have repeated thoughts about self-harming and feel like you have to do it</li>\n<li>you may disassociate (lose touch with yourself and your surroundings) and self-harm without realising you are doing it</li>\n<li>it can be a symptom of borderline personality disorder (a condition that causes instability in how a person thinks, feels and behaves).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Treatment</h2>\n<div>\n<p>It is important for anyone who self-harms to see their GP, who will aim to treat the underlying emotional cause as well as any physical injury.</p>\n<p>Your GP is likely to ask you about your feelings in some detail. They will want to establish why you self-harm, what triggers it and how you feel afterwards.</p>\n<p>Your GP may ask you some questions to see if you have an underlying condition such as depression, anxiety or borderline personality disorder. If the way you self-harm follows a particular pattern of behaviour, such as an eating disorder, you may be asked additional questions about this. Your height, weight and blood pressure may also be checked, and you may be asked about any drinking or drug-taking habits.</p>\n<p>It is important that you are honest with your GP about your symptoms and your feelings. If you don&rsquo;t know why you self-harm, tell your GP this.</p>\n<h2>Specialist referral</h2>\n<p>Recent research indicates that most teenagers who self-harm are able to give up this behaviour as they learn to manage feelings in healthier ways, for example, by talking to others.</p>\n<p>However, some young people who self-harm continue to do so into adulthood and if you fall into this category, your GP may refer you to a mental health professional. This could be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a counsellor&nbsp;&ndash; somebody who is trained in talking therapies</li>\n<li>a psychiatrist &ndash; a qualified medical doctor with further training in treating mental health conditions</li>\n<li>a&nbsp;<a>psychologist</a>&nbsp;&ndash; a health professional who specialises in the assessment and treatment of mental health conditions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, if you have lost a close relative, you may be referred to a specialist grief counsellor for help coping with bereavement. If you are self-harming after an incident of rape, or physical or mental abuse, you may be referred to someone who is trained in dealing with victims of sexual assault or domestic abuse.</p>\n<p>If you have another condition that is linked to your self-harming, such as anorexia nervosa or bulimia, you may be referred to a specialist in eating disorders and a dietitian or nutritionist (somebody who specialises in nutrition).</p>\n<p>It might also be recommended that you attend a self-help group, for example, Alcoholics Anonymous if you are misusing alcohol, or Narcotics Anonymous if you are misusing drugs. These groups can offer support as you try to stop your self-harming behaviour.</p>\n<h2>Assessment</h2>\n<p>You may be offered a psychosocial assessment, which aims to investigate all the factors that contribute to your self-harming, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>social factors &ndash; for example, your relationships with others</li>\n<li>psychological factors &ndash; your feelings and emotions</li>\n<li>motivational factors &ndash; what made you want to do it</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You will be asked about your current feelings, particularly if you are feeling hopeless or considering suicide. If you have any other symptoms, either physical or emotional, you will also be asked about these.</p>\n<p>After the assessment you will be allowed to read through what has been written to make sure that you agree with it. Any further treatment will, if possible, be decided jointly between you and your mental health professional. It will be a specific programme for you according to your needs and what is likely to be effective. You will be asked for your consent before any treatment begins.</p>\n<h2>Seeking immediate help for an injury or overdose</h2>\n<p>Some physical injuries may need treating in an accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department. For example, you may need to call 999 for an ambulance if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you or somebody else have taken an overdose of drugs, alcohol or prescription medication</li>\n<li>somebody is unconscious</li>\n<li>you or somebody else are in a lot of pain</li>\n<li>you or somebody else are having difficulty breathing</li>\n<li>you or somebody else are losing a lot of blood from a cut or wound</li>\n<li>you or somebody else are in shock after a serious cut or burn</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>','Self-harm','2023-07-09 11:05:43','2023-07-09 11:05:43',NULL),(30,29,NULL,'Anxiety','<h1>Anxiety:</h1>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Anxiety is a feeling of unease, such as worry or fear, that can be mild or severe.</p>\n<p>Everyone has feelings of anxiety at some point in their life. For example, you may feel worried and anxious about sitting an exam or having a medical test or job interview. During times like these, feeling anxious can be perfectly normal.</p>\n<p>However, some people find it hard to control their worries. Their feelings of anxiety are more constant and can often affect their daily life.</p>\n<p>Anxiety is the main symptom of several conditions, including panic disorder, phobias, post-traumatic stress disorder and social anxiety disorder (social phobia).</p>\n<p>However, the information in this section is about a specific condition called generalised anxiety disorder (GAD).</p>\n<h2>Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD)</h2>\n<p>GAD is a long-term condition that causes you to feel anxious about a wide range of situations and issues, rather than one specific event.</p>\n<p>People with GAD feel anxious most days and often struggle to remember the last time they felt relaxed. GAD can cause both psychological (mental) and physical symptoms. These vary from person to person, but can include feeling restless or worried and having trouble concentrating or sleeping.</p>\n<p>Read about the&nbsp;<a>symptoms of GAD</a></p>\n<h3>When to see your GP</h3>\n<p>Although feelings of anxiety at certain times are completely normal, you should see your GP if anxiety is affecting your daily life or is causing you distress.</p>\n<p>Your GP will ask you about your symptoms and your worries, fears and emotions to try to find out if you could have GAD.</p>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;<a>diagnosing GAD</a></p>\n<h3>What causes GAD?</h3>\n<p>The exact cause of GAD is not fully understood, although it\'s likely that a combination of several factors plays a role. Research has suggested these may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>overactivity in areas of the brain involved in emotions and behaviour</li>\n<li>an imbalance of the brain chemicals serotonin and noradrenaline, which are involved in the control and regulation of mood</li>\n<li>the genes you inherit from your parents &ndash; you\'re estimated to be five times more likely to develop GAD if you have a close relative with the condition</li>\n<li>having a history of stressful or traumatic experiences, such as domestic violence, child abuse or bullying</li>\n<li>having a painful long-term health condition, such as&nbsp;<a>arthritis</a></li>\n<li>having a history of drug or&nbsp;<a>alcohol misuse</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, many people develop GAD for no apparent reason.</p>\n<h3>Who is affected?</h3>\n<p>GAD is a common condition estimated to affect about 1 in every 25 people in the UK.</p>\n<p>Slightly more women are affected than men, and the condition is more common in people between the ages of 35 and 55.</p>\n<h3>How GAD is treated</h3>\n<p>GAD can have a significant effect on your daily life, but several different treatments are available that can help ease your symptoms. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>psychological therapy&ndash; such as&nbsp;cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)</li>\n<li>medication &ndash; such as a type of antidepressant called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are also many things you can do yourself to help reduce your anxiety, such as going on a self-help course, exercising regularly, stopping smoking and cutting down on the amount of alcohol and caffeine you drink.</p>\n<p>With treatment, many people are able to control their levels of anxiety. However, some treatments may need to be continued for a long time and there may be periods where your symptoms worsen.</p>\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) can affect you both physically and mentally.</p>\n<p>How severe the symptoms are varies from person to person. Some people have only one or two symptoms, while others have many more.</p>\n<p>You should see your GP if anxiety is affecting your daily life or is causing you distress.</p>\n<h2>Psychological symptoms of GAD</h2>\n<p>GAD can cause a change in your behaviour and the way you think and feel about things, resulting in symptoms such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>restlessness</li>\n<li>a sense of dread</li>\n<li>feeling constantly \"on edge\"</li>\n<li>difficulty concentrating</li>\n<li>irritability</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your symptoms may cause you to withdraw from social contact (seeing your family and friends) to avoid feelings of worry and dread.</p>\n<p>You may also find going to work difficult and stressful and may take time off sick. These actions can make you worry even more about yourself and increase your lack of self-esteem.</p>\n<h2>Physical symptoms of GAD</h2>\n<p>GAD can also have a number of physical symptoms, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>dizziness</li>\n<li>tiredness</li>\n<li>a noticeably strong, fast or irregular heartbeat (<a>palpitations</a>)</li>\n<li>muscle aches and tension</li>\n<li>trembling or shaking</li>\n<li><a >dry mouth</a></li>\n<li>excessive sweating</li>\n<li><a>shortness of breath</a></li>\n<li>stomach ache</li>\n<li>feeling sick</li>\n<li><a>headache</a></li>\n<li>pins and needles</li>\n<li>difficulty falling or staying asleep (<a>insomnia</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Anxiety triggers</h2>\n<p>If you are anxious as a result of a specific phobia or because of panic disorder, you will usually know what the cause is. For example, if you have claustrophobia (a fear of enclosed spaces), you know that being confined in a small space will trigger your anxiety.</p>\n<p>However, if you have GAD, it may not always be clear what you are feeling anxious about. Not knowing what triggers your anxiety can intensify it and you may start to worry that there will be no solution.</p>\n<h2>Diagnosis</h2>\n<div>\n<p>See your GP if anxiety is affecting your daily life or is causing you distress.</p>\n<p>Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) can be difficult to diagnose. In some cases, it can also be difficult to distinguish from other mental health conditions, such as depression.</p>\n<h2>Talking to your GP about anxiety</h2>\n<p>Your GP may ask you questions about your worries, fears and emotions. They may also ask about your personal life. Tell your GP about all your symptoms &ndash; physical and psychological &ndash; and explain how long you have had them for.</p>\n<p>You may find it difficult to talk about your feelings, emotions and personal life. However, it is important that your GP understands your symptoms and circumstances so that the correct diagnosis can be made.</p>\n<p>You are most likely to be diagnosed with GAD if you have had the symptoms for six months or more. Finding it difficult to manage your feelings of anxiety is also an indication that you may have the condition.</p>\n<p>To help with the diagnosis, your GP may carry out a physical examination or blood tests to rule out other conditions that may be causing your symptoms, such as anaemia (a&nbsp;<a>deficiency in iron</a>&nbsp;or vitamin B12 and folate) or an overactive thyroid gland (<a>hyperthyroidism</a>).</p>\n<h2>Do you have GAD?</h2>\n<p>You may have generalised anxiety disorder if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>your worrying significantly affects your daily life, including your job and social life</li>\n<li>your worries are extremely stressful and upsetting</li>\n<li>you worry about all sorts of things and have a tendency to think the worst</li>\n<li>your worrying is uncontrollable</li>\n<li>you have felt worried nearly every day for at least six months</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Treatment</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is a long-term condition, but a number of different treatments can help.</p>\n<p>Before you begin any form of treatment, your GP should discuss all your treatment options with you. They should outline the pros and cons of each and make sure you are aware of any possible risks or side effects.</p>\n<p>With your GP, you can make a decision on the treatment most suited to you, taking into account your personal preferences and circumstances.</p>\n<p>If you have other problems alongside GAD, such as&nbsp;<a>depression</a>&nbsp;and drug or&nbsp;<a>alcohol misuse</a>, these may need to be treated before having treatment specifically for GAD.</p>\n<h2>Initial treatment</h2>\n<p>At first, your GP may suggest trying an individual self-help course for a month or two to see if it can help you learn to cope with your anxiety.</p>\n<p>This will usually involve working from a book or computer programme on your own (you will be given advice about how to use the book or programme before you start), with only occasional contact with your doctor.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you may prefer to go on a group course where you and a few other people with similar problems meet with a therapist every week to learn ways to tackle your anxiety.</p>\n<p><a>Read more&nbsp;about these treatments</a></p>\n<p>If these initial treatments do not help, you will usually be offered either a more intensive psychological treatment or medication. These are described below.</p>\n<h2>Psychological treatment</h2>\n<p>If you have been diagnosed with GAD, you will usually be advised to try psychological treatment before you are prescribed medication.</p>\n<h4>Cognitive behavioural therapy</h4>\n<p>Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is one of the most effective treatments for GAD. Studies of different treatments for GAD have found that the benefits of CBT may last longer than those of medication, but no single treatment is best for everyone.</p>\n<p>CBT helps you to understand how your problems, thoughts, feelings and behaviour affect each other. It can also help you to question your negative and anxious thoughts, and do things you would usually avoid because they make you anxious.</p>\n<p>CBT will usually involve meeting with a specially trained and accredited therapist for a one-hour session every week for three to four months.</p>\n<p>Your therapist should carry out CBT in a standardised way according to a treatment manual, and they should receive regular supervision to support them in providing the most effective treatments.</p>\n<h4>Applied relaxation</h4>\n<p>Applied relaxation is an alternative type of psychological treatment that can be as effective as CBT in treating GAD.</p>\n<p>Applied relaxation focuses on relaxing your muscles in a particular way during situations that usually cause anxiety. The technique needs to be taught by a trained therapist, but generally involves:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>learning how to relax your muscles</li>\n<li>learning how to relax your muscles quickly and in response to a trigger, such as the word \"relax\"</li>\n<li>practising relaxing your muscles in situations that make you anxious</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As with CBT, applied relaxation therapy will usually mean meeting with a therapist for a one-hour session every week for three to four months.</p>\n<h2>Medication</h2>\n<p>If the psychological treatments above have not helped you or you would prefer not to try them, you will usually be offered medication.</p>\n<p>Your GP can prescribe a variety of different types of medication to treat GAD. Some medication is designed to be taken on a short-term basis, while other medicines are prescribed for longer periods.</p>\n<p>Depending on your symptoms, you may require medicine to treat your physical symptoms as well as your psychological ones.</p>\n<p>If you are considering taking medication for GAD, your GP should discuss the different options with you in detail, including the different types of medication, length of treatment, side effects and possible interactions with other medicines, before you start a course of treatment.</p>\n<p>You should also have regular appointments with your doctor to assess your progress when you are taking medication for GAD. These will usually take place every two to four weeks for the first three months, then every three months after that.</p>\n<p>Tell your GP if you think you may be experiencing side effects from your medication. They may be able to adjust your dose or prescribe an alternative medication.</p>\n<p>The main medications you may be offered to treat GAD are described below.</p>\n<h4>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</h4>\n<p>In most cases, the first medication you will be offered will be a type of antidepressant called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). This type of medication works by increasing the level of a chemical called serotonin in your brain.</p>\n<p>Examples of SSRIs you may be prescribed include sertraline, escitalopram and paroxetine.</p>\n<p>SSRIs can be taken on a long-term basis but, as with all antidepressants, they can take several weeks to start working. You will usually be started on a low dose, which will gradually be increased as your body adjusts to the medicine.</p>\n<p>Common side effects of SSRIs include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>feeling sick</li>\n<li>low sex drive</li>\n<li>blurred vision</li>\n<li>diarrhoea or constipation</li>\n<li>dizziness</li>\n<li>dry mouth</li>\n<li>loss of appetite</li>\n<li>sweating</li>\n<li>feeling agitated</li>\n<li>problems sleeping (insomnia)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of the side effects &ndash; such as feeling sick, an upset stomach, problems sleeping and feeling agitated or more anxious &ndash; are more common in the first one or two weeks of treatment, but these will usually settle as your body adjusts to the medication.</p>\n<p>If you or your GP feels that your medication is not helping after about two months of treatment, or if it is causing unpleasant side effects, your GP may prescribe an alternative SSRI to see if that has any effect.</p>\n<p>When you and your GP decide that it is appropriate for you to stop taking your medication, you will normally have your dose slowly reduced over the course of a few weeks to reduce the risk of withdrawal effects. Never stop taking your medication unless your GP specifically advises you to.</p>\n<h4>Serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)</h4>\n<p>If SSRIs do not help ease your anxiety, you may be prescribed a different type of antidepressant known as a serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). This type of medicine increases the amount of the chemicals serotonin and noradrenaline in your brain.</p>\n<p>Examples of SNRIs you may be prescribed include venlafaxine and duloxetine.</p>\n<p>Common side effects of SNRIs include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>feeling sick</li>\n<li><a>headaches</a></li>\n<li>drowsiness</li>\n<li>dizziness</li>\n<li><a>dry mouth</a></li>\n<li><a>constipation</a></li>\n<li><a>insomnia</a></li>\n<li>sweating</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SNRIs can also increase your blood pressure, so your blood pressure will be monitored regularly during treatment.</p>\n<p>As with SSRIs, some of the side effects &ndash; such as feeling sick, an upset stomach, problems sleeping and feeling agitated or more anxious &ndash; are more common in the first one or two weeks of treatment, but these will usually settle as your body adjusts to the medication.</p>\n<h4>Pregabalin</h4>\n<p>If SSRIs and SNRIs are not suitable for you, you may be offered pregabalin. This is a medication known as an anticonvulsant, which is used to treat conditions such as epilepsy (a condition that causes repeated seizures). However, it has also been found to be beneficial in treating anxiety.</p>\n<p>Side effects of pregabalin can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>drowsiness</li>\n<li>dizziness</li>\n<li>increased appetite and weight gain</li>\n<li>blurred vision</li>\n<li>headaches</li>\n<li>dry mouth</li>\n<li><a>vertigo</a>&nbsp;(the sensation that you, or the environment around you, is moving or spinning)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Pregabalin is less likely to cause nausea or a low sex drive than SSRIs or SNRIs.</p>\n<h4>Benzodiazepines</h4>\n<p>Benzodiazepines are a type of sedative that may sometimes be used as a short-term treatment during a particularly severe period of anxiety because they help ease the symptoms within 30 to 90 minutes of taking the medication.</p>\n<p>Examples of benzodiazepines you may be prescribed include chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and lorazepam.</p>\n<p>Although benzodiazepines are very effective in treating the symptoms of anxiety, they cannot be used for long periods of time because they can become addictive if used for longer than four weeks. Benzodiazepines also start to lose their effectiveness after this time.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, you will not usually be prescribed benzodiazepines for any longer than two to four weeks at a time.</p>\n<p>Side effects of benzodiazepines can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>drowsiness</li>\n<li>difficulty concentrating</li>\n<li>headaches</li>\n<li>vertigo</li>\n<li>tremor (an uncontrollable shake or tremble in part of the body)</li>\n<li><a>low sex drive</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>As drowsiness is a particularly common side effect of benzodiazepines, your ability to drive or operate machinery may be affected by taking this medication. You should therefore avoid these activities during treatment.</p>\n<h2>Referral to a specialist</h2>\n<p>If you have tried the treatments mentioned above and have significant symptoms of GAD, you may want to discuss with your GP whether you should be referred to a mental health specialist.</p>\n<p>A referral will work differently in different areas of the UK, but you will usually be referred to your community mental health team. These teams include a range of specialists, including psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses, clinical psychologists, occupational therapists and social workers.</p>\n<p>An appropriate mental health specialist from your local team will carry out an overall reassessment of your condition. They will ask you about your previous treatment and how effective you found it.</p>\n<p>They may also ask about things in your life that may be affecting your condition, or how much support you get from family and friends.</p>\n<p>Your specialist will then be able to devise a treatment plan for you, which will aim to effectively treat your symptoms.</p>\n<p>As part of this plan, you may be offered a treatment you have not tried before, which might be one of the psychological treatments or medications mentioned above.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you may be offered a combination of a psychological treatment with a medication, or a combination of two different medications.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>','Anxiety','2023-07-09 11:05:43','2023-07-09 11:05:43',NULL),(31,30,NULL,'Eating disorders:','<h1>Eating disorders:</h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>About eating disorders</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Eating disorders change someone&rsquo;s attitude towards food and their body in a way that influences their behaviour and eating habits. For example, an eating disorder can cause you to spend a lot of time thinking about your weight and body shape, and do things like avoid eating as much as possible, or exercise more than is healthy.</p>\n<p>These changes in eating habits and behaviour can affect you physically, mentally, and socially.</p>\n<h2>Types of eating disorders</h2>\n<p>There are a number of different types of eating disorder.

These include avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). ARFID causes a person to avoid certain foods or types of food, restrict how much they eat, or both.</p>\n<h2>Causes of eating disorders</h2>\n<div class=\"editor\">\n<p>Eating disorders are often blamed on the social pressure to be thin, but the causes are usually more complex. There are lots of possible reasons why a person might develop an eating disorder, and the causes are different for everybody.</p>\n<p>These causes can be thought of as psychological, environmental, or biological.</p>\n<h3>Psychological causes</h3>\n<p>Many people who develop eating disorders share certain patterns of thinking and behaviour. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a tendency towards feeling low in mood, or anxious</li>\n<li>finding it difficult to cope with stress</li>\n<li>finding it hard to express feelings</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Environmental causes</h3>\n<p>Environmental causes are parts of the world around a person, and events happening in their life, that can affect their mental wellbeing in a variety of ways.<br />These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>pressure from society to look a certain way</li>\n<li>big, stressful life changes</li>\n<li>difficult life experiences, such as abuse or bullying</li>\n<li>difficult relationships with friends or family</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Biological and genetic causes</h3>\n<p>Some people may be more likely to develop an eating disorder because of the way their brain works, and how that affects their body. For example, having a family history of eating disorders can mean a person is more likely to develop one.</p>\n<h2>Outlook and treatment for eating disorders</h2>\n<div>\n<p>An eating disorder can have a major impact on a person&rsquo;s life, including their relationships, job, schoolwork, and physical health. Without treatment, in the most extreme cases, eating disorders can be fatal.</p>\n<p>With all eating disorders, the first step is recognising that there&rsquo;s a problem and being willing to seek help. If you&rsquo;re worried that you have an eating disorder, the first step towards getting help is usually speaking to your GP.</p>\n<h3>Treating eating disorders</h3>\n<p>Treating an eating disorder usually involves monitoring a person&rsquo;s physical health while helping them with their mental health. The type of treatment used depends on the person involved, how serious their condition is, and what type of eating disorder they have.</p>\n<p>For some people, self-help or guided self-help can be effective and help them to change the way they think about food and body shape.</p>\n<p>When guided self-help isn&rsquo;t appropriate, or wouldn&rsquo;t be effective enough on its own, the main treatment is&nbsp;<a >psychological therapy</a>.</p>\n<p>Medication alone isn&rsquo;t usually effective for eating disorders.

It can limit what you\'re able to do during the day, affect your mood, and lead to relationship problems with friends, family and colleagues.</p>\n<h2>How much sleep do I need?</h2>\n<p>There are no official guidelines about how much sleep you should get each night because everyone is different.</p>\n<p>On average, a \"normal\" amount of sleep for an adult is considered to be around seven to nine hours a night. Children and babies may sleep for much longer than this, whereas older adults may sleep less.</p>\n<p>What\'s important is whether you feel you get enough sleep, and whether your sleep is good quality.</p>\n<p>You\'re probably not getting enough good-quality sleep if you constantly feel tired throughout the day and it\'s affecting your everyday life.</p>\n<h2>What causes insomnia?</h2>\n<p>It\'s not always clear what triggers insomnia, but it\'s often associated with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>stress and anxiety</li>\n<li>a poor sleeping environment &ndash; such as an uncomfortable bed, or a bedroom that\'s too light, noisy, hot or cold</li>\n<li>lifestyle factors &ndash; such as jet lag, shift work, or drinking alcohol or caffeine before going to bed</li>\n<li>mental health conditions &ndash; such as&nbsp;<a>depression</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a>schizophrenia</a></li>\n<li>physical health conditions &ndash; such as heart problems,&nbsp;other sleep disorders and long-term pain</li>\n<li>certain medicines &ndash; such as some&nbsp;<a>antidepressants</a>,&nbsp;<a>epilepsy</a>&nbsp;medicines and&nbsp;<a>steroid medication</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read more about the&nbsp;<a>causes of insomnia</a></p>\n<h2>What you can&nbsp;do about it</h2>\n<p>There are a number of things you can try to help yourself get a good night\'s sleep if you have insomnia.</p>\n<p>These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>setting regular times for going to bed and waking up</li>\n<li>relaxing before bed time&nbsp;&ndash; try taking a warm bath or listening to calming music</li>\n<li>using thick curtains or blinds, an eye mask and earplugs to stop you being woken up by light and noise</li>\n<li>avoiding caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, heavy meals&nbsp;and exercise for a few hours before going to bed</li>\n<li>not watching TV or using phones, tablets or computers shortly before&nbsp;going to bed&nbsp;</li>\n<li>not napping during the day</li>\n<li>writing a list of your worries, and any ideas&nbsp;about&nbsp;how to&nbsp;solve them, before going to bed to help you forget about&nbsp;them until the morning</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some people find over-the-counter sleeping tablets helpful, but they don\'t address the underlying problem and can have troublesome side effects.</p>\n<p>Read more&nbsp;<a >self-help tips for insomnia</a></p>\n<h2>When to see your GP</h2>\n<p>Make an appointment to see your GP if you\'re finding it difficult to get to sleep or stay asleep and it\'s affecting your daily life &ndash; particularly if it has been a problem for a month or more and the above measures have not helped.</p>\n<p>Your GP may ask you about your sleeping routines, your daily alcohol and caffeine consumption, and your general lifestyle habits, such as diet and exercise.</p>\n<p>They will also check your medical history for any illness or medication that may be contributing to your insomnia.</p>\n<p>Your GP may suggest keeping a sleep diary for a couple of weeks to help them gain a better understanding of your sleep patterns.</p>\n<p>Each day, make a note of things such as the time you went to bed and woke up, how long it took you to fall asleep, and the number of times you woke up during the night.</p>\n<h2>Treatments for&nbsp;insomnia</h2>\n<p>Your GP will first try to identify and treat any underlying health condition, such as anxiety, that may be causing your sleep problems.</p>\n<p>They\'ll probably also discuss things you can do at home that may help to improve your sleep.</p>\n<p>In some cases, a special type of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)&nbsp;designed for people with insomnia (CBT-I) may be recommended.</p>\n<p>This is a type of talking therapy that aims to help you avoid the thoughts and behaviours affecting your sleep. It\'s usually the first treatment recommended and can help lead to long-term improvement of your sleep.</p>\n<p>Prescription sleeping tablets are usually only considered as a last resort and should be used for only a few days or weeks at a time.</p>\n<p>This is because they don\'t treat the cause of your insomnia and are associated with a number of side effects. They can also become less effective over time.</p>\n<h2>Causes</h2>\n<div class=\"editor\">\n<p>Insomnia can be triggered by a number of possible factors, including worry and stress, underlying health conditions, and alcohol or drug use.</p>\n<p>Sometimes it\'s not possible to identify a clear cause.</p>\n<h2>Stress and anxiety</h2>\n<p>Some people develop insomnia after a stressful event, such as a bereavement, problems at work, or financial difficulties.</p>\n<p>The problem can continue long after the event has passed because they start to associate going to bed with being awake. This develops into an anxiety about sleep itself.</p>\n<p>Having more general worries&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;for example, about work, family or health&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;are also likely to keep you awake at night.</p>\n<p>These can cause your mind to start racing while you lie in bed, which can be made worse by also worrying about not being able to sleep.</p>\n<h2>Poor sleep routine and&nbsp;sleeping environment</h2>\n<p>You may struggle to get a good night\'s sleep if you go to bed at inconsistent times, nap during the day, or don\'t \"wind down\" before going to bed.</p>\n<p>A poor sleeping environment can also contribute to insomnia&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;for instance, an uncomfortable bed or a bedroom that\'s too bright, noisy, hot or cold.</p>\n<h2>Lifestyle factors</h2>\n<p>Drinking alcohol before going to bed and taking certain recreational drugs can affect your sleep, as can stimulants such as nicotine (found in cigarettes) and caffeine (found in tea, coffee and energy drinks). These should be avoided in the evenings.</p>\n<p>Changes to your sleeping patterns can also contribute to insomnia&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;for example, because of shift work or changing time zones after a long-haul flight (jet lag).</p>\n<h2>Mental health conditions</h2>\n<p>Underlying mental health problems can often affect a person\'s sleeping patterns, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>mood disorders &ndash; such as&nbsp;<a>depression</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>bipolar disorder</a></li>\n<li>anxiety disorders&ndash; such as generalised anxiety,&nbsp;<a>panic disorder</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a >post-traumatic stress disorder</a></li>\n<li>psychotic disorders &ndash; such as&nbsp;<a>schizophrenia</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical health&nbsp;conditions</h2>\n<p>Insomnia can also be caused by underlying physical conditions, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>heart conditions &ndash; such as&nbsp;<a >angina</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>heart failure</a></li>\n<li>respiratory conditions &ndash; such as&nbsp;<a>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>asthma</a></li>\n<li>neurological&nbsp;conditions &ndash; such as&nbsp;<a>Alzheimer\'s disease</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>Parkinson\'s disease</a></li>\n<li>hormonal problems &ndash; such as an&nbsp;<a>overactive thyroid</a></li>\n<li>joint or muscle problems &ndash; such as&nbsp;<a>arthritis</a></li>\n<li>problems with the genital or urinary organs &ndash; such as&nbsp;<a >urinary incontinence</a>&nbsp;or an&nbsp;<a >enlarged prostate</a></li>\n<li>sleep disorders &ndash; such as snoring and&nbsp;<a>sleep apnoea</a>,&nbsp;<a>restless legs syndrome</a>,&nbsp;narcolepsy, night terrors and sleepwalking</li>\n<li>long-term pain</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In women, childbirth can sometimes lead to insomnia.</p>\n<h2>Medication</h2>\n<p>Some prescriptions or over-the-counter medications can cause insomnia as a side effect.</p>\n<p>These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>certain&nbsp;<a>antidepressants</a></li>\n<li><a>epilepsy</a>&nbsp;medicines</li>\n<li>medicines for&nbsp;<a>high blood pressure</a>, such as&nbsp;<a >beta-blockers</a></li>\n<li><a >steroid medication</a></li>\n<li><a>non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</a></li>\n<li>stimulant medicines used to treat&nbsp;<a>attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)</a>&nbsp;or narcolepsy</li>\n<li>some medicines used to treat asthma, such as salbutamol, salmeterol and theophylline</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Check the leaflet that comes with any medication you\'re taking to see if insomnia or sleeping difficulties are listed as a possible side effect.</p>\n<h2>Self-help tips</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Insomnia can often be improved by changing your daytime and bedtime habits or by improving your bedroom environment.</p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<p>Making small changes may help you to get a good night\'s sleep. Try some of the methods below for a few weeks to see if they help.</p>\n<p>See your GP if you\'re still having difficulty getting to sleep after trying these techniques.</p>\n<h2>Daytime habits</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Set a specific time for getting up each day. Try to stick to this time, seven days a week, even if you feel you haven\'t had enough sleep. This should help you sleep better at night.</li>\n<li>Don\'t take a nap during the day.</li>\n<li>Take daily exercise, such as 30 minutes&nbsp;<a>walking</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a >cycling</a>. But don\'t exercise for at least four hours before going to bed, because this may make it more difficult to fall asleep.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bedtime habits</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Stop drinking tea and coffee for a few hours before bedtime.</li>\n<li>Avoid drinking alcohol and smoking, particularly shortly before going to bed.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Don\'t eat a big meal just before bedtime.</li>\n<li>Only go to bed when you\'re feeling tired. If necessary, go to bed later than usual if it means you might be able to fall asleep more quickly.</li>\n<li>Don\'t use back-lit devices shortly before going to bed, including televisions, phones, tablets and computers.</li>\n<li>Try to create a relaxing bedtime routine, such as taking a bath, listening to soft music, and drinking a warm, milky drink every night. These activities will be associated with sleep and will cause drowsiness.</li>\n<li>Avoid regularly using over-the-counter sleeping tablets. It is not clear how effective these are, they don\'t tackle the underlying problem, and have potential side effects. Read more about&nbsp;<a >treatments for insomnia</a>.</li>\n<li>Don\'t lie in bed feeling anxious about lack of sleep. Instead, get up, go to another room for about 20 minutes and do something else, such as reading or listening to soft music, before trying again.</li>\n<li>Avoid watching the clock because it will only make you anxious about how long it\'s taking you to fall asleep.</li>\n<li>Write a list of your worries and any ideas to solve them before going to bed. This may help you forget about them until the morning.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bedroom environment</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Use thick blinds or curtains or wear an eye mask if the early morning sunlight or bright street lamps affect your sleep.</li>\n<li>Make sure your bedroom is at a comfortable temperature for sleeping.</li>\n<li>Wear ear plugs if noise is a problem.</li>\n<li>Don\'t use your bedroom for anything other than sleeping or sex. Avoid watching television, making phone calls, eating or working while you\'re in bed.</li>\n<li>Make sure your mattress is comfortable and that you have a pillow you like, as well as adequate bedding for the time of year.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Treatments</h2>\n<div class=\"editor\">\n<p>Insomnia will often improve by making changes to your bedtime habits. If these don\'t help, your GP may be able to recommend other treatments.</p>\n<p>If you\'ve had insomnia for more than four weeks, your GP may recommend cognitive and behavioural treatments or suggest a short course of prescription sleeping tablets as a temporary measure.</p>\n<p>If it\'s possible to identify an underlying cause of your sleeping difficulties, treating this may be enough to return your sleep to normal.</p>\n<p>The various treatments for&nbsp;insomnia are outlined below.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Good sleeping habits</h2>\n<p>Your GP will be able to advise you about what you can do at home to help you sleep. This is known as \"sleep hygiene\" and includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>establishing fixed times for going to bed and waking up</li>\n<li>creating a relaxing bedtime routine</li>\n<li>only going to bed when you feel tired</li>\n<li>maintaining a comfortable sleeping environment that\'s not too hot, cold, noisy or bright</li>\n<li>not napping during the day</li>\n<li>avoiding caffeine, nicotine and alcohol late at night</li>\n<li>avoiding eating a heavy meal late at night</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read more&nbsp;<a>about self-help tips for&nbsp;insomnia</a></p>\n<h2>Cognitive and behavioural treatments</h2>\n<p>If changing your sleeping habits doesn\'t help, your GP may be able to refer you for a type of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)&nbsp;that\'s specifically designed for people with insomnia (CBT-I).</p>\n<p>The aim of&nbsp;CBT-I is to change unhelpful thoughts and behaviours that may be contributing to your insomnia. It\'s&nbsp;an effective treatment for many people and can have long-lasting results.</p>\n<p>CBT-I&nbsp;may&nbsp;include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>stimulus-control therapy &ndash; which aims to help you associate the bedroom with sleep and establish a consistent sleep/wake pattern</li>\n<li>sleep restriction therapy &ndash; limiting the amount of time spent in bed to the actual amount of time spent asleep, creating mild sleep deprivation; sleep time is then increased as your sleeping improves</li>\n<li>relaxation training &ndash; aims to reduce tension or minimise intrusive thoughts that may be interfering with sleep</li>\n<li>paradoxical intention &ndash; you try to stay awake and avoid any intention of falling asleep; it\'s used if you have trouble getting to sleep, but not maintaining sleep</li>\n<li>biofeedback &ndash; sensors connected to a machine are placed on your body to measure your body\'s functions, such as muscle tension and heart rate; the machine produces pictures or sounds to help you recognise when you\'re not relaxed&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>CBT-I is&nbsp;sometimes carried out by a specially trained GP. Alternatively, you may be referred to a clinical psychologist.</p>\n<p>The therapy may be carried out in a small group with other people who have similar sleep problems, or one-to-one with a therapist. Self-help books and online courses may also be used.</p>\n<h2>Sleeping tablets</h2>\n<p>Sleeping tablets (hypnotics) are medications that encourage sleep. In the past, they were frequently used to help with insomnia, but they\'re used much less often nowadays.</p>\n<p>They will generally only be considered:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>if your insomnia is severe</li>\n<li>as a temporary measure to help ease short-term insomnia</li>\n<li>if the good sleep habits and cognitive and behavioural treatments mentioned above don\'t help</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Doctors are usually reluctant to recommend sleeping tablets in the long-term because they just mask the symptoms without treating the underlying cause.</p>\n<p>They can also cause potentially dangerous side effects, such as drowsiness the following morning, and some people become dependent on them.</p>\n<p>If they are recommended, you should have the smallest effective dose possible for the shortest time (usually no more than two to four weeks).&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Over-the-counter sleeping pills</h3>\n<p>A number of sleeping tablets are available to buy over the counter (OTC) from pharmacies. These are usually a type of&nbsp;antihistamine medicine that causes you to feel drowsy.</p>\n<p>Taking OTC sleeping tablets regularly isn\'t usually recommended if you have insomnia, because it\'s not clear how effective they are, they don\'t tackle the underlying cause of your sleeping difficulties and they can cause side effects.</p>\n<p>In particular, they can cause you to feel drowsy the next morning, which can make activities such as driving and operating machinery dangerous.</p>\n<p>Speak to your GP for advice if you find yourself needing to take OTC sleeping tablets regularly.</p>\n<h3>Benzodiazepines</h3>\n<p>Benzodiazepines are prescription medicines that can reduce anxiety and promote calmness, relaxation and sleep. Your GP may prescribe them for a short time if you have severe insomnia or it\'s causing extreme distress.</p>\n<p>Examples of benzodiazepines include temazepam, loprazolam, lormetazepam, diazepam and nitrazepam.</p>\n<p>Long-term treatment with benzodiazepines isn\'t usually recommended because they can become less effective over time and some people become dependent upon them.</p>\n<p>They can also cause a number of side effects, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>drowsiness and&nbsp;dizziness, which can persist into the next day</li>\n<li>finding it difficult to concentrate or make decisions</li>\n<li><a>depression</a>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>feeling emotionally numb</li>\n<li>irritability</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should avoid driving if you feel drowsy, dizzy, or unable to concentrate or make decisions, as you may not be able to do so safely.</p>\n<h3>Z-drugs</h3>\n<p>Z&ndash;drugs are a newer type of medicine that work in a similar way to benzodiazepines and are similarly effective. They include zaleplon, zolpidem and zopiclone.</p>\n<p>As with benzodiazepines, long-term treatment with Z&ndash;drugs isn\'t normally recommended because they can become less effective over time and some people become dependent on them.</p>\n<p>They\'re usually only prescribed for a maximum of two to four weeks.</p>\n<p>Side effects of Z-drugs can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>drowsiness and dizziness, which can persist into the next day</li>\n<li>feeling and being sick</li>\n<li><a>diarrhoea</a>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>increased&nbsp;snoring and breathing problems during sleep</li>\n<li>dry mouth</li>\n<li>confusion</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Z&ndash;drugs can also sometimes cause psychiatric reactions, such as delusions,&nbsp;nightmares and hallucinations. Contact your GP if you experience any of these effects.</p>\n<p>Read the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance on&nbsp;<a>zaleplon, zolpidem and zopiclone for the short-term management of insomnia</a>&nbsp;for more information.</p>\n<h3>Melatonin (Circadin)</h3>\n<p>For adults aged 55 or over, a medication called Circadin is sometimes used to help relieve insomnia for a few weeks. It contains a naturally occurring hormone called melatonin, which helps to regulate the sleep cycle.</p>\n<p>Circadin is usually only recommended for three weeks at first, but it can be continued for a total of 13 weeks if it helps.</p>\n<p>Common side effects of Circadin include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a>headaches</a></li>\n<li>cold-like symptoms</li>\n<li>back pain</li>\n<li>joint pain</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Treatments that aren\'t recommended</h2>\n<p>The following treatments aren\'t normally recommended for insomnia, because it\'s not clear how effective they are and they can sometimes cause side effects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a>antidepressants</a>&nbsp;(unless you also have depression)</li>\n<li>chloral hydrate</li>\n<li>clomethiazole</li>\n<li>barbiturates</li>\n<li>herbal remedies, such as valerian extract</li>\n<li>complementary and alternative therapies, such as&nbsp;acupuncture, hypnotherapy and reflexology</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>','Insomnia','2023-07-09 11:05:43','2023-07-09 11:05:43',NULL),(34,33,NULL,'Panic disorder:','<h1>Panic disorder:</h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Panic disorder is where you have recurring and regular panic attacks, often for no apparent reason.</p>\n<p>Everyone experiences feelings of&nbsp;anxiety and panic at certain times during their lifetime. It\'s a natural response to stressful or&nbsp;dangerous situations.</p>\n<p>However, for someone with panic disorder, feelings of anxiety, stress and panic occur regularly and at any time.</p>\n<h2>Anxiety</h2>\n<p>Anxiety is a feeling of unease. It can range from mild to severe and can include feelings of worry and fear. There are several conditions that can cause severe anxiety including</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a>phobias</a>&nbsp;&ndash; an extreme or irrational fear of an object, place, situation, feeling or animal</li>\n<li>generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) &ndash; a long-term condition that causes excessive anxiety and worry relating to a variety of situations</li>\n<li>post-traumatic stress disorder &ndash; a condition with psychological and physical symptoms caused by distressing or frightening events</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Panic attacks</h2>\n<p>A panic attack occurs when your body experiences a rush of intense psychological (mental) and physical symptoms.</p>\n<p>You may experience an overwhelming sense of fear, apprehension and anxiety. As well as these feelings, you may also have physical symptoms such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>nausea</li>\n<li>sweating</li>\n<li>trembling</li>\n<li>a sensation that your heart is beating irregularly (palpitations)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The number of panic attacks you have will depend on how severe your condition is.

An attack won\'t cause you any physical harm, and it\'s unlikely that you\'ll be admitted to hospital if you\'ve had a panic attack.</p>\n<h2>What causes panic disorder?</h2>\n<p>As with many mental health conditions, the exact cause of panic disorder isn\'t fully understood.</p>\n<p>However, it\'s thought the condition is probably linked to a combination of physical and psychological factors.</p>\n<p>Read about the possible&nbsp;<a>causes of panic disorder</a>.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to be aware that some physical conditions and disorders can have similar symptoms to those of anxiety.

Treatment for panic disorder is much more effective if it\'s given at an early stage.</p>\n<p>Left untreated, panic disorder can become a very debilitating and isolating illness. It can also increase your risk of developing other mental health conditions, such as agoraphobia or other&nbsp;<a>phobias</a>.</p>\n<p>Agoraphobia is a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult, or help wouldn\'t be available if things go wrong.</p>\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\n<div>\n<p>The symptoms of a panic attack can be very frightening and distressing.</p>\n<p>Symptoms tend to occur suddenly, without warning and often for no apparent reason.</p>\n<p>As well as overwhelming feelings of anxiety, a panic attack can also cause a variety of other&nbsp;symptoms, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a sensation that your heart is beating irregularly (<a>palpitations</a>)</li>\n<li>sweating</li>\n<li>trembling</li>\n<li>hot flushes</li>\n<li>chills</li>\n<li><a>shortness of breath</a>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>a choking sensation</li>\n<li>chest pain</li>\n<li>nausea</li>\n<li>dizziness</li>\n<li>feeling&nbsp;faint</li>\n<li>numbness or&nbsp;pins and needles</li>\n<li>dry mouth</li>\n<li>a need to go to the toilet</li>\n<li>ringing in your ears&nbsp;</li>\n<li>a feeling of dread or a fear of dying</li>\n<li>a churning stomach</li>\n<li>a tingling sensation in your fingers</li>\n<li>shivering</li>\n<li>shaking</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The physical symptoms of a panic attack are unpleasant, and they can also be accompanied by thoughts of fear and terror.</p>\n<p>For this reason, people with panic disorder start to fear the next attack, which&nbsp;creates a&nbsp;cycle of living in &lsquo;fear of fear&rsquo; and adds to the sense of panic.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, the symptoms of a panic attack can be so intense they can make you feel like you\'re having a&nbsp;<a >heart attack</a>.</p>\n<p>However, it\'s important to be aware that symptoms such as a racing heartbeat and shortness of breath won\'t result in you having a heart attack. Although panic attacks can often be frightening, they don\'t cause any physical harm. People who have had panic disorder for some time usually learn to recognise this \'heart attack sensation\' and&nbsp;become more aware of how to control their symptoms.</p>\n<p>Most panic attacks last for five to 20 minutes.&nbsp;Some attacks have been reported to have lasted up to an hour. However, it\'s likely that in these cases one attack occurred straight after another or high levels of anxiety were felt after the first attack.</p>\n<h2>Recurrent panic attacks</h2>\n<p>People with panic disorder have panic attacks on a recurring basis. Some people have attacks once or twice a month, while others have them several times a week.</p>\n<p>People with panic disorder also tend to have ongoing and constant feelings of worry and anxiety. The panic attacks associated with panic disorder can be very unpredictable.</p>\n<p>If you have panic disorder, you may also&nbsp;feel&nbsp;anxious about when your next attack will be.</p>\n<h2>Depersonalisation</h2>\n<p>During a panic attack your symptoms can be so intense and out of your control that you can&nbsp;feel detached from the situation, your body and your surroundings. It can almost feel as if you\'re an observer, making the situation seem very unreal.</p>\n<p>This sense of detachment is known as depersonalisation. Being detached from the situation doesn\'t provide any relief or make a panic attack less frightening. Instead, it often makes the experience more confusing and disorientating.</p>\n<h2>Causes</h2>\n<div>\n<p>As with many mental health conditions, the exact cause of panic disorder isn\'t fully understood.</p>\n<p>It\'s thought that panic disorder is probably caused by a combination of physical and psychological factors. Some of these factors are outlined below.</p>\n<h2>Traumatic life experiences</h2>\n<p>A trauma, such as&nbsp;<a>bereavement</a>, can sometimes trigger feelings of panic and anxiety. These feelings may be obvious soon after the event or they may be triggered unexpectedly years later.</p>\n<h2>Genetics</h2>\n<p>Having a close family member with panic disorder is thought to increase a person\'s risk of developing it. However, the precise nature of the risk isn\'t known.</p>\n<h2>Neurotransmitters</h2>\n<p>Neurotransmitters are chemicals that occur naturally in the brain. It\'s thought that an imbalance of these chemicals may increase your risk of developing conditions such as panic disorder.</p>\n<h2>Increased sensitivity to carbon dioxide</h2>\n<p>Some experts believe that panic disorder is linked to an increased sensitivity to carbon dioxide. Breathing in air with high carbon dioxide levels can bring on panic attacks, and breathing techniques can help to relieve or stop panic attacks.</p>\n<h2>Catastrophic thinking</h2>\n<p>Another theory is that people who experience panic attacks tend to focus on&nbsp;minor physical symptoms and interpret them in a catastrophic way. This triggers a nervous system response that causes the panic attack.</p>\n<h2>Diagnosis</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Everyone who has panic disorder will experience panic attacks.</p>\n<p>However, not everyone who has&nbsp;panic attacks is diagnosed with panic disorder.</p>\n<h2>Panic attacks</h2>\n<p>Some people have panic attacks in response to specific situations. For example, they may have a phobia (overwhelming fear) of enclosed spaces (claustrophobia) and have a panic attack when faced with an enclosed space.</p>\n<p>While most people with&nbsp;<a>phobias</a>&nbsp;only experience panic attacks when faced with the thing that&nbsp;triggers their fear, the panic attacks of people with panic disorder usually occur without warning and for no obvious reason.</p>\n<p>This means that panic disorder will only be diagnosed after experiencing recurrent and unexpected panic attacks, and if the attacks are followed by at least one month of continuous worry or concern about having further attacks.</p>\n<h2>Talk to your GP</h2>\n<p>Your GP will ask you to describe the symptoms you\'ve been experiencing. They\'ll also ask you how often your symptoms occur and in what situations.</p>\n<p>It\'s important to tell your GP about how you\'ve been feeling and how your symptoms have affected you.</p>\n<p>Although it can sometimes be difficult to talk to someone else about your feelings, emotions and personal life,&nbsp;try not to feel anxious or embarrassed.</p>\n<p>Your GP needs to gain a good understanding of your symptoms to&nbsp;make the correct diagnosis and recommend the most appropriate treatment for you.</p>\n<h2>Physical examination</h2>\n<p>Your GP may also want to carry out a physical examination to look for signs of any physical conditions that could be causing your symptoms.</p>\n<p>For example, an&nbsp;<a>overactive thyroid</a>&nbsp;gland (hyperthyroidism) can sometimes cause similar symptoms to a panic attack.</p>\n<p>By ruling out any underlying medical conditions, your GP will be able to make the correct diagnosis.</p>\n<h2>Treatment</h2>\n<div>\n<p>The main aim in treating panic disorder is to reduce the number of panic attacks and ease the severity of symptoms.</p>\n<p>Psychological therapy and medication are the two main types of treatment for panic disorder.</p>\n<p>Depending on your individual circumstances, you may need one of these treatment types or a combination of the two.</p>\n<p>If you\'re offered psychological therapy, it will probably be in the form of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). If this doesn\'t work, medication may be recommended.</p>\n<p>Before starting any form of treatment, your GP will discuss all of the options with you, outlining the advantages of each type and making you aware of any possible risks or side effects.</p>\n<p>No single treatment works for everyone and you may need to try a number of treatments before finding one that works for you. The treatment that\'s recommended will depend on your general level of health, the severity of your condition and your personal preferences.</p>\n<p>It\'s important you understand what your treatment will involve. If you don\'t understand something your GP has told you, ask them to explain it in more detail.</p>\n<h2>Cognitive behavioural therapy</h2>\n<p>Psychological therapy has proven long-term benefits and it\'s recommended for treating panic disorder. It will usually take the form of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).</p>\n<p>CBT is thought to be one of the most effective psychological treatments for panic disorder. It involves having regular sessions with a therapist.</p>\n<p>The therapist may discuss with you how you react when you have a panic attack and what you think about when you\'re experiencing an attack.</p>\n<p>Once you and your therapist have identified any negative thoughts and beliefs, you can work on replacing them with more realistic and balanced ones. Your therapist can also teach you ways of changing your behaviour, making it easier for you to deal with future panic attacks.</p>\n<p>For example, they may be able to show you breathing techniques that can be used to help keep you calm during a panic attack.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<a>National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)</a>&nbsp;recommends a total of seven to 14 hours of CBT to be completed within a four month period. Treatment will usually involve having a weekly one to two hour session.</p>\n<p>NICE also recommends that in certain situations a shorter programme of CBT may be appropriate. This can involve a reduced number of hours of CBT with &lsquo;homework&rsquo; being set between sessions so that you can practice what you\'ve learnt after each session.</p>\n<p>You should visit your GP regularly&nbsp;while you\'re having CBT so that they can assess your progress and see how you\'re doing.</p>\n<h2>Support groups</h2>\n<p>Support groups can provide useful information and advice about how you can effectively manage your panic disorder. They\'re also a good way of meeting other people who\'ve had similar experiences of the condition.</p>\n<p>Panic attacks can sometimes be frightening and isolating, so it can be helpful to know that other people are experiencing the same feelings and emotions as you.</p>\n<p><a>Anxiety UK</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a>Triumph Over Phobia (TOP UK)</a>&nbsp;are UK-based charities that provide information and support for people with anxiety disorders.</p>\n<p>Support groups often involve face-to-face meetings where you can talk about your problems and difficulties with others. Many can also provide support and guidance over the telephone or in writing.</p>\n<p>Ask your GP about support groups for panic disorder near you. You can also use the services directory to&nbsp;<a>find anxiety services in your area</a>.</p>\n<h2>Antidepressants</h2>\n<p><a>Antidepressants</a>&nbsp;are often associated with&nbsp;<a>depression</a>, but they can also be used to treat a number of other psychological conditions.</p>\n<p>Antidepressants can take two to four weeks before becoming effective. It\'s therefore important to continue taking them, even if you feel they\'re&nbsp;not working. You should only ever stop taking prescribed medication if your GP specifically advises you to do so.</p>\n<p><a>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</a>&nbsp;and tricyclic antidepressants are two types of antidepressants that are often recommended for treating&nbsp;panic disorder.</p>\n<p>When starting a new type of medication, you should be regularly assessed by your GP at two, four, six and 12 week intervals. This will allow you to discuss any issues that you have with your medication, and enables your GP to assess which treatment is most effective. It will also provide you with the opportunity to try a different type of medication if you want to.</p>\n<h3>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</h3>\n<p>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors&nbsp;(SSRIs) are a type of antidepressant that work by increasing the level of a chemical called serotonin in your brain.</p>\n<p>They\'re the most commonly prescribed type of antidepressant for treating panic disorder. They\'re usually started at a low dose before gradually being increased as your body adjusts to the medicine.</p>\n<p>Common side effects of SSRIs include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>nausea</li>\n<li><a>headaches</a>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>low sex drive&nbsp;(loss of libido)</li>\n<li>blurred vision</li>\n<li><a>diarrhoea</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>constipation</a></li>\n<li>dizziness</li>\n<li>dry mouth&nbsp;</li>\n<li>loss of appetite</li>\n<li>sweating</li>\n<li>feeling agitated</li>\n<li><a>insomnia</a>&nbsp;(sleep problems)</li>\n<li>abdominal pain</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you first start taking SSRIs, your feelings of&nbsp;anxiety and panic may get slightly worse. In most cases, this is temporary and your symptoms will start to return to normal levels within a few days of taking the medicine.</p>\n<p>Speak to your GP if you feel that your symptoms have got worse and that they\'re not showing signs of returning to normal levels after a few days.</p>\n<p>After you start to take a SSRI, you should visit your GP after two, four, six, and 12 weeks so that they can check on your progress and see whether you\'re responding to the medicine. Not everyone responds well to antidepressant medicines, so it\'s important that your progress is carefully monitored.</p>\n<p>If your GP feels it necessary, you may require regular&nbsp;<a>blood tests</a>&nbsp;or blood pressure checks when taking antidepressants. If after 12 weeks of taking the medication you don\'t show any signs of improvement, your GP may prescribe an alternative SSRI to see if it has any effect.</p>\n<p>The length of time that you\'ll have to take a SSRI for will vary depending on how well you respond to the treatment. Even if you feel that your panic disorder has been successfully treated, it\'s likely that you\'ll need to keep taking the medication for at least six to 12 months.</p>\n<p>If you stop taking your medication before this time, the risk of your symptoms recurring may be increased. Some people may have to take SSRIs for longer than the usual six to 12 month period.</p>\n<p>When you and your GP decide that it\'s appropriate for you to stop taking SSRIs, you will gradually be weaned off them by slowly reducing your dosage. As with antidepressants, you should never stop taking SSRIs&nbsp;unless your GP specifically advises you to.</p>\n<p>Stopping your medication straight away without being weaned off, or without seeking advice from your GP, may result in withdrawal symptoms such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>dizziness</li>\n<li>numbness and tingling</li>\n<li>nausea and vomiting</li>\n<li>headache</li>\n<li>anxiety</li>\n<li>sleep disturbances</li>\n<li>sweating</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These symptoms can also occur if you miss a dose of medication, or if your dose is reduced. The symptoms are usually mild, but they can be severe if the medication is stopped suddenly.</p>\n<p>For some people, this means having to take SSRIs on a long-term basis. For others, a course of CBT can help to reduce the risk of their symptoms recurring.</p>\n<p>Contact your GP if you experience troublesome side effects that&nbsp;don\'t ease.</p>\n<h3>Tricyclic antidepressants</h3>\n<p>If SSRIs aren\'t suitable, or if your symptoms don\'t improve after a 12 week course of SSRIs, your GP may try prescribing a different type of antidepressant.</p>\n<p>Tricyclic antidepressants work in a similar way to SSRIs. They regulate the levels of the chemicals noradrenaline and serotonin in your brain, which has a positive effect on your feelings and mood.</p>\n<p>Imipramine&nbsp;and&nbsp;clomipramine are two tricyclic antidepressants that are often prescribed to treat panic disorder. Tricyclic antidepressants aren\'t addictive.</p>\n<p>SSRIs are usually prescribed before tricyclic antidepressants because they have fewer side effects. Common side effects of tricyclic antidepressants include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>constipation</li>\n<li>difficulty urinating</li>\n<li>blurred vision</li>\n<li>dry mouth</li>\n<li>weight gain or weight loss</li>\n<li>drowsiness</li>\n<li>sweating</li>\n<li>lightheadedness</li>\n<li>skin rash</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The side effects should ease after seven to 10&nbsp;days as your body starts to get used to the medication. However, see your GP if they become troublesome and don\'t ease.</p>\n<h2>Pregabalin</h2>\n<p>Pregabalin is another medication that&rsquo;s often used to treat panic disorder. It&rsquo;s an anticonvulsant that\'s also used to treat&nbsp;<a>epilepsy</a>&nbsp;(a condition that causes repeated seizures). However, it\'s also been found to be beneficial in treating anxiety.</p>\n<p>Side effects of pregabalin can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>drowsiness</li>\n<li>dizziness</li>\n<li>increased appetite and weight gain</li>\n<li>blurred vision</li>\n<li><a>headaches</a></li>\n<li>dry mouth</li>\n<li><a>vertigo</a>&nbsp;&ndash; the sensation that you, or the environment around you, are moving or spinning</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Pregabalin is less likely to cause nausea or a low sex drive than SSRIs.</p>\n<h2>Clonazepam</h2>\n<p>Clonazepam is another medication that&rsquo;s often used to treat epilepsy and is also sometimes prescribed for panic disorder.</p>\n<p>It can cause a wide variety of side effects including lethargy (lack of energy), abnormal eye movement (nystagmus), confusion and allergic reactions.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>','Panic disorder:','2023-07-09 11:05:43','2023-07-09 11:05:43',NULL),(35,34,NULL,'Personality Disorder','<h1>Personality Disorder:</h1> <h2>Introduction</h2> <div> <p>Personality disorders are conditions in which an individual differs significantly from an average person, in terms of how they think, perceive, feel or relate to others.</p> <p>Changes in&nbsp;how a person feels and distorted beliefs about other people can lead to odd behaviour, which can be distressing and may upset others.</p> <p>Common features include:</p> <ul> <li>being overwhelmed by negative feelings such as distress, anxiety, worthlessness or anger</li> <li>avoiding other people&nbsp;and feeling empty and emotionally disconnected</li> <li>difficulty managing negative feelings without&nbsp;self-harming (for example, abusing drugs and alcohol, or taking overdoses) or, in rare cases,&nbsp;threatening other people&nbsp;</li> <li>odd behaviour</li> <li>difficulty maintaining stable and close relationships,&nbsp;especially with partners, children and professional carers&nbsp;</li> <li>sometimes, periods of losing contact with reality</li> </ul> <p>Symptoms typically get worse with&nbsp;<a>stress</a>.</p> <p>People with personality disorders often&nbsp;experience other mental health problems, especially&nbsp;<a>depression</a>&nbsp;and substance misuse.</p> <h2>When and why personality disorders occur</h2> <p>Personality disorders typically&nbsp;emerge in adolescence and continue into adulthood.</p> <p>They may be mild, moderate or severe, and people may have periods of \"remission\" where they function well.</p> <p>Personality disorders&nbsp;may be associated with&nbsp;genetic&nbsp;and family factors. Experiences of distress or fear during childhood, such as neglect or abuse, are common.</p> <h2>Types of personality disorder</h2> <p>Several&nbsp;different types of personality disorder are recognised.&nbsp;They&nbsp;have been&nbsp;broadly grouped into one of three clusters &ndash; A, B or C &ndash; which are summarised below.</p> <p>Read about the&nbsp;<a>symptoms of personality disorders</a>&nbsp;for a full list of the main types and signs of personality disorders.</p> <h3>Cluster A personality disorders</h3> <p>A person with a cluster A personality disorder tends to have difficulty relating to others&nbsp;and usually shows patterns of behaviour&nbsp;most people would regard as odd and eccentric. Others may describe them as living in&nbsp;a fantasy world of their own.</p> <p>An example is paranoid personality disorder, where the person is extremely distrustful and suspicious.</p> <h3>Cluster B personality disorders</h3> <p>A person with a cluster B personality disorder struggles to regulate their feelings and often swings between positive and negative views of others. This can lead to patterns of behaviour others describe as dramatic, unpredictable and disturbing.</p> <p>An example is borderline personality disorder, where the person is emotionally unstable, has impulses to self-harm, and has intense and unstable relationships with others.</p> <h3>Cluster C personality disorders</h3> <p>A person with a cluster C personality disorder struggles with persistent and overwhelming feelings of fear and anxiety. They&nbsp;may show patterns of behaviour most people would regard as antisocial and withdrawn.</p> <p>An example is avoidant personality disorder, where the person appears painfully shy,&nbsp;socially inhibited, feels inadequate and is extremely sensitive to rejection. The person may want to be close to others,&nbsp;but lacks confidence to form a close relationship.</p> <h2>How many people are affected?</h2> <p>Personality disorders are common mental health problems.</p> <p>In England, it is estimated that around 1 in 20 people has a personality disorder. However, many people have only mild conditions so only need help at times of stress (such as bereavement). Other people with more severe problems may need specialist help for longer periods.</p> <h2>Outlook</h2> <p>Many&nbsp;people recover from personality disorders over time. Psychological or medical treatment is sometimes helpful; sometimes support is all that is needed. This depends on the severity of the disorder and whether there are ongoing problems.</p> <p>Some&nbsp;mild to moderate personality disorders improve with&nbsp;<a>psychotherapy</a>.</p> <p>Different types of psychological therapies have been shown to help people with personality disorders. However, there is no single approach that suits everyone and treatment should be tailored to the individual. Not all talking therapies are effective and it is essential&nbsp;they are delivered by a trained therapist.</p> <h2>Signs and symptoms of personality disorders</h2> <div> <p>The different types of personality disorder that might need treatment can be broadly grouped into one of three clusters, called A, B or C.</p> <h2>Cluster A personality disorders</h2> <p>A person with a cluster A personality disorder tends to have difficulty relating to others and usually shows patterns of behaviour&nbsp;most people would regard as odd and eccentric.</p> <p>The main personality disorders in this category are listed below.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Paranoid personality disorder</h3> <p>A person with a paranoid personality disorder is extremely distrustful and suspicious. Other features include:</p> <ul> <li>thinking other people are lying to them or trying to manipulate them</li> <li>feeling they cannot really trust their friends and associates</li> <li>worrying that any confidential information shared with others will be used against them</li> <li>thinking there are hidden meanings in remarks most&nbsp;would regard as innocent</li> <li>worrying that their spouse or partner is unfaithful, despite a lack of evidence</li> </ul> <h3>Schizoid personality disorder&nbsp;</h3> <p>Someone with a schizoid personality disorder may appear cold and detached, and&nbsp;avoid making close social contact with others. Other&nbsp;features include:</p> <ul> <li>preferring to take part in activities that do not require interaction with others</li> <li>having little desire to form close relationships, including sexual relationships</li> <li>being uninterested when receiving criticism or praise</li> <li>having a limited ability to experience pleasure or joy</li> </ul> <h3>Schizotypal personality disorder</h3> <p>A person with a schizotypal personality disorder is likely to have poor social skills and delusional thoughts, and behave in unusual ways. Other&nbsp;features include:</p> <ul> <li>attaching undue and misguided significance to everyday events &ndash; such as thinking newspaper headlines are secret messages to them</li> <li>believing in special powers &ndash; such as telepathy or the ability to influence other people&rsquo;s emotions and actions</li> <li>having unusual ways of speaking &ndash; such as long, rambling vague sentences or going off on a tangent</li> <li>experiencing excessive anxiety in social situations &ndash; even if they have known a particular person or group of people&nbsp;a long time</li> </ul> <h2>Cluster B personality disorders</h2> <p>Someone with a cluster B personality disorder struggles to relate to others.&nbsp;As a result, they&nbsp;show&nbsp;patterns of behaviour&nbsp;most&nbsp;would regard as dramatic, erratic and threatening or disturbing.</p> <p>The main personality disorders in this category are listed below.</p> <h3>Antisocial personality disorder</h3> <p>A person with an antisocial personality disorder sees other people as vulnerable and may intimidate or bully others without remorse. They lack concern about the consequences of their actions.</p> <p>Symptoms include:</p> <ul> <li>lack of concern, regret or remorse about other people\'s distress</li> <li>irresponsibility and disregard for normal social behaviour</li> <li>difficulty in sustaining long-term relationships</li> <li>little ability to tolerate frustration and to control their anger</li> <li>lack of guilt, or not learning from their mistakes</li> <li>blaming others for problems in their lives</li> </ul> <p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has published guidelines on how people with antisocial personality disorders should be treated. For more information, see&nbsp;<a>NICE: antisocial personality disorder (PDF, 250kb)</a>.</p> <h3>Borderline personality disorder</h3> <p>A person with borderline personality disorder is emotionally unstable, has impulses to self-harm, and has very intense and unstable relationships with others.</p> <h3>Histrionic personality disorder</h3> <p>A person with histrionic personality disorder is anxious about being ignored.&nbsp;As a result, they&nbsp;feel a&nbsp;compulsion (overwhelming urge) to be noticed and the centre of everyone&rsquo;s attention.&nbsp;Features&nbsp;include:</p> <ul> <li>displaying excessive emotion, yet appearing to lack real emotional sincerity</li> <li>dressing provocatively and engaging in inappropriate flirting or sexually seductive behaviour</li> <li>moving quickly from one emotional state to another</li> <li>being self-centred and caring little about other people</li> <li>constantly seeking reassurance and approval from other people</li> </ul> <p>Symptoms and signs may co-exist with borderline and narcissistic personality disorders.</p> <h3 id=\"Narcissistic\">Narcissistic personality disorder</h3> <p>A person with narcissistic personality disorder swings between seeing themselves as special and fearing they are worthless. They may act as if they have an inflated sense of their own importance and show an intense need for other people to look up to them.</p> <p>Other symptoms include:</p> <ul> <li>exaggerating their own achievements and abilities</li> <li>thinking they are entitled to be treated better than other people</li> <li>exploiting other people for their own personal gain</li> <li>lacking empathy for other people\'s weaknesses&nbsp;</li> <li>looking down on people they feel are \"beneath\" them, while feeling deeply envious of people they see as being \"above\" them</li> </ul> <h2>Cluster C personality disorders</h2> <p>Someone with a cluster C personality disorder fears personal relationships and shows patterns of anxious and fearful behaviour around other people. Others may be withdrawn and reluctant to socialise.</p> <p>The main personality disorders&nbsp;in this category are listed below.</p> <h3>Avoidant personality disorder</h3> <p>A person with avoidant personality disorder appears painfully shy, is socially inhibited, feels inadequate and is extremely sensitive to rejection.</p> <p>Unlike people with schizoid personality disorders, they desire close relationships with others, but lack the confidence and ability to form them.</p> <h4>Dependent personality disorder</h4> <p>A person with dependent personality disorder feels&nbsp;they have no ability to be independent. They may show an excessive need&nbsp;for others to look after them and are \"clingy\". Other&nbsp;features include:</p> <ul> <li>finding it difficult to make decisions without other people&rsquo;s guidance</li> <li>needing others to take responsibility over what should be their own important life choices</li> <li>not being able to express disagreement with other people</li> <li>finding it difficult to start new activities due to a lack of confidence</li> <li>going to extremes to obtain support and comfort</li> <li>feeling helpless and uncomfortable when alone</li> <li>urgently needing to start a new relationship once a previous relationship comes to an end</li> <li>having an unrealistic and constant fear they will be left alone to fend for themselves</li> </ul> <h3>Obsessive compulsive personality disorder</h3> <p>A person with obsessive compulsive personality disorder is anxious about issues that seem out of control or \"messy\". They are preoccupied with orderliness and ways to control their environment, and may come across to others as a \"control freak\".</p> <p>Other&nbsp;features include:</p> <ul> <li>having an excessive interest in lists, timetables and rules</li> <li>being so concerned with completing a task perfectly that they have problems completing&nbsp;it (perfectionism)</li> <li>being a workaholic</li> <li>having very rigid views about issues such as morality, ethics and how a person should behave in daily life</li> <li>hoarding items that seem to have no monetary or sentimental value</li> <li>being unable to delegate tasks to other people</li> <li>disliking spending money, as they think it is always better to save for a \"rainy day\"</li> </ul> <p>This personality disorder differs from&nbsp;<a>obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)</a>, a related mental health condition, in several important ways:</p> <ul> <li>People with OCD are aware that their behaviour is abnormal and are anxious about it.&nbsp;Most people with obsessive compulsive personality disorder think their behaviour is perfectly acceptable and have no desire to change it.</li> <li>Some&nbsp;people with OCD are compelled to carry out rituals, such as having to touch every second lamppost as they walk down the street. This is not usually the case with people with obsessive compulsive personality disorder.</li> <li>People with OCD may feel compelled to make lists or organise items in their house, but feel anxious about doing so.&nbsp;People with obsessive compulsive personality disorder find relief&nbsp;from anxiety when doing such tasks and may become irritated when&nbsp;prevented from doing so.</li> </ul> <h2>Treating a personality disorder</h2> <div> <p>Treatment for most personality disorders usually involves a course of psychological therapy. This normally lasts at least six months, often longer, depending on the severity of the condition and other co-existing problems.</p> <h2>Psychological therapies</h2> <p><a>Psychotherapy</a>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;treatment&nbsp;that involves discussion of thoughts, emotions and behaviours with a trained professional. The aim of all psychological therapies is to improve people\'s ability to regulate their thoughts and emotions.</p> <p>Some therapies focus on dysfunctional thoughts, while others&nbsp;focus on self-reflection and being aware of how your own mind works. Some therapies, especially group therapies, help people understand social relationships better.</p> <p>Psychological therapies can be effective for many personality disorders. However, they should only be delivered by a trained professional who has experience of working with personality disorders and other clinical conditions. This is because personality disorders are serious conditions that can be associated with high-risk behaviours, such as self-harm.</p> <p>As well as listening and discussing important issues with you, the psychotherapist can suggest strategies to resolve problems and, if necessary, can help you change your attitudes and behaviour.</p> <p>A&nbsp;range of different psychotherapies are used to treat personality disorders. They can be broadly classified into three types of therapy, outlined below.</p> <h3>Psychodynamic (reflective) psychotherapy</h3> <p>Psychodynamic psychotherapy is based on the idea that many adult patterns of behaviour are&nbsp;related to negative early childhood experiences. These experiences cause patterns of distorted thinking and beliefs that may have been understandable in childhood, but do not work in adult life. The goal of therapy is to explore these distortions, understand how they arose, and find effective ways to overcome their influence on your thinking and behaviour.</p> <p>Both individual and group psychodynamic therapy may be helpful for personality disorders, especially borderline personality disorder (BPD). A particular form, called mentalisation-based therapy, is recommended for BPD.</p> <h3>Cognitive behavioural therapy</h3> <p>Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)&nbsp;is based on the theory that how we think about a situation affects how we act. In turn, our actions can affect how we think and feel. Therefore, it is necessary to change both the act of thinking (cognition) and behaviour at the same time.</p> <p>A type of CBT called dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) has proved successful in helping people reduce impulsive self-harming behaviours, especially in BPD. DBT is designed to help you cope better with emotional instability, while at the same time encouraging you to behave in a more positive way.</p> <h3>Interpersonal therapy</h3> <p>Interpersonal therapy (IPT) is based on the theory that our relationships with other people and the outside world in general have a powerful effect on our mental health.</p> <p>Several personality disorders&nbsp;may be associated with feelings of low self-esteem, anxiety and self-doubt, caused by problems interacting with people.</p> <p>During IPT, the therapist will explore any negative issues associated with your interpersonal relationships and how these issues can be resolved.</p> <h2>Therapeutic communities</h2> <p>Therapeutic communities (TCs) are a form of group therapy, in which the experience of having a personality disorder is explored in depth. TCs are an intensive form of therapy.</p> <p>The minimum type of TC is one day a week, but others are 9am-5pm,&nbsp;five days a week.&nbsp;They have been shown to be effective for mild to moderate personality disorders, but require a high level of commitment.</p> <h2>Medication</h2> <p>No medication is currently licensed for the treatment of any personality disorder. However, medications may be prescribed to treat associated problems, such as&nbsp;<a>depression</a>, anxiety or&nbsp;<a>psychotic symptoms</a>.</p> <p>For example, if you have moderate to severe symptoms of depression that make it difficult to approach your therapy with confidence or enthusiasm, you may be prescribed a type of&nbsp;<a >antidepressant</a>&nbsp;called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).</p> <p>Some people, especially those with BPD, have found mood-stabilising medication helpful.</p> </div> </div> </div>','Personality Disorder','2023-07-09 11:05:43','2023-07-09 11:05:43',NULL),(36,35,NULL,'Phobias','<h1>Phobias:</h1>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<div >\n<p>A phobia is more than a simple fear. It develops when a person begins to organise their life around avoiding the thing they are afraid of, whether it&rsquo;s an animal, object, place or situation.</p>\n<p>A phobia is a type of&nbsp;<a>anxiety</a>&nbsp;disorder. If you have a phobia, you will have an overwhelming need to avoid all contact with the source of your anxiety. Coming into contact with the cause of your phobia or even the thought of this can make you anxious and may cause you to panic.</p>\n<p>If the cause of your phobia is an object or animal that you do not come into contact with regularly, such as a snake, it is unlikely to affect your day-to-day life. However, if you have a more complex phobia, such as agoraphobia (see below), you may find it very difficult to lead a normal life.</p>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;<a>the symptoms of phobias</a></p>\n<h2>Types of phobia</h2>\n<p>There are many different phobias, which can be divided into two main categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>simple phobias</li>\n<li>complex phobias</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although most people are aware of a phobia, it may help to identify some complex phobias by speaking to a GP and answering questions about your anxiety.</p>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;<a >how phobias are diagnosed</a></p>\n<h2>Simple phobias</h2>\n<p>Simple phobias are fears about specific objects, animals, situations or activities.

Some people only react with mild anxiety when confronted with the object of their fear, while others experience severe anxiety or have a severe panic attack.</p>\n<h2>Complex phobias</h2>\n<p>Complex phobias tend to be more disabling than simple phobias because they are often associated with a deep-rooted fear or anxiety about a particular circumstance or situation. Two common examples of complex phobias are agoraphobia and social phobia.</p>\n<p>Agoraphobia is a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult, or help wouldn\'t be available if things go wrong.</p>\n<p>A person with agoraphobia may be scared of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>travelling on public transport</li>\n<li>visiting a shopping centre</li>\n<li>and in the most severe cases &ndash; leaving home</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Social phobia is a fear of social situations, such as weddings, or performing in social situations, such as public speaking. People with a social phobia have a fear of embarrassing themselves or of being humiliated in public.</p>\n<h2>How common are phobias?</h2>\n<p>Phobias are the most common type of anxiety disorder. In the UK, an estimated 10 million people have phobias. Phobias can affect anyone, regardless of age, sex and social background.</p>\n<p>Simple phobias, such as a fear of going to the dentist, usually start during early childhood, often between the ages of four and eight. Simple phobias often disappear on their own as the child gets older and usually do not cause problems in adulthood.</p>\n<p>Complex phobias usually start later in life. Social phobias often begin during puberty and agoraphobia in the late teens to early twenties. Sometimes, complex phobias continue for many years.</p>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;<a>the causes of phobias</a></p>\n<h2>How are phobias treated?</h2>\n<p>Almost all phobias can be successfully treated and cured. Treating simple phobias involves gradually becoming exposed to the animal, object, place or situation that causes fear. This is known as desensitisation or self-exposure therapy. You could try these methods with the help of a professional or by using self-help techniques.</p>\n<p>Treating complex phobias often takes longer and involves talking therapies, such as counselling, psychotherapy and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).</p>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;<a>how phobias are treated</a></p>\n<p>Medication is not usually used to treat phobias. However, it is sometimes prescribed to help people cope with the effects of anxiety. The medication used may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>antidepressants</li>\n<li>tranquilisers</li>\n<li>beta-blockers</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\n<div>\n<p>All phobias, particularly complex phobias such as agoraphobia (a fear of open spaces and public places), can limit your daily activities and may cause severe anxiety and depression.</p>\n<p>People with phobias usually need to avoid contact with the thing that causes fear and anxiety. How far someone with a phobia will go to avoid contact varies considerably.</p>\n<p>For example, someone with a fear of spiders (arachnophobia) may not want to touch a spider, whereas someone else with the same fear may not even want to look at a picture of one.</p>\n<h2>Physical symptoms</h2>\n<p>Panic attacks are common among people with phobias. They can be very frightening and distressing. The symptoms often occur suddenly and without warning.</p>\n<p>As well as overwhelming feelings of anxiety, a panic attack can cause physical symptoms including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sweating</li>\n<li>trembling</li>\n<li>hot flushes or chills</li>\n<li><a>shortness of breath</a>&nbsp;or difficulty breathing</li>\n<li>a choking sensation</li>\n<li>rapid heartbeat (tachycardia)</li>\n<li>chest pain or a feeling of tightness in the chest</li>\n<li>a sensation of butterflies in the stomach</li>\n<li>nausea</li>\n<li><a>headaches</a>&nbsp;and dizziness</li>\n<li>feeling faint</li>\n<li>numbness or pins and needles</li>\n<li><a>dry mouth</a></li>\n<li>a need to go to the toilet</li>\n<li>ringing in your ears</li>\n<li>feeling confused or disorientated</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In severe cases, you may also experience psychological symptoms such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>fear of losing control</li>\n<li>fear of fainting</li>\n<li>feelings of dread</li>\n<li>fear of dying</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Complex phobias</h2>\n<p>Like simple phobias, complex phobias, such as agoraphobia and social phobia, can affect your wellbeing.</p>\n<p>Agoraphobia often involves a combination of several interlinked phobias. For example, someone with a fear of going outside or leaving their home may also have a fear of being left alone (monophobia) or of places where they feel trapped (claustrophobia).</p>\n<p>The symptoms experienced by agoraphobics vary in severity. Some people feel very apprehensive and anxious if they have to leave their home to visit the shops, whereas others may feel relatively comfortable travelling a short distance from their home.</p>\n<p>If you have a social phobia, the thought of being seen in public or appearing at social events can make you feel very anxious and frightened. These situations can make you feel vulnerable.</p>\n<p>Intentionally avoiding meeting people in social situations, such as at a dinner party, is a sign of social phobia. As with agoraphobia, in extreme cases of social phobia, some people are too afraid to leave their home.</p>\n<p>It may take some time to overcome a complex phobia but there are several treatment options for phobias available, including talking therapies and self-help techniques.</p>\n<h2>Causes</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Phobias usually develop during childhood, adolescence or early adulthood following a frightening event or a stressful situation. However, it is not always clear why some phobias occur.</p>\n<h2>Simple phobias</h2>\n<p>Simple phobias usually develop in early childhood, often between the ages of four and eight. A simple phobia can sometimes be traced to an early childhood experience. For example, if a young child is trapped in a confined space, they may develop a fear of enclosed spaces (claustrophobia) when they are older.</p>\n<p>If someone shares the same phobia with another family member, such as a fear of spiders (arachnophobia), this may be because they learned to fear spiders as a child, rather than the phobia being passed on genetically (running in families).</p>\n<h2>Complex phobias</h2>\n<p>The exact causes of complex phobias, such as agoraphobia and social phobia, are unknown. However, it is thought that genetics, brain chemistry and life experiences may all play a part in the development of these phobias.</p>\n<p>Social phobias may be caused by a previous intense or anxious experience in a social situation. Alternatively, a person&rsquo;s social confidence may not have had the chance to fully develop past the normal stage of shyness experienced as a young child.</p>\n<h2>Diagnosis</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Most people with a phobia are usually fully aware that they have one. Many people live with a phobia without having it formally diagnosed and take great care to avoid the thing they are afraid of.</p>\n<p>However, if you have a phobia, getting help from your GP and a specialist with expertise in behavioural therapy, such as a psychologist, can often be beneficial. You may also choose to book an appointment privately.</p>\n<h2>Complex phobias</h2>\n<p>If you have a complex phobia, such as agoraphobia (a fear of open spaces and public places) or social phobia, see your GP. They may refer you to a mental healthcare specialist, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist, who can help.</p>\n<h2>Agoraphobia</h2>\n<p>The anxiety disorder charity Anxiety UK has produced a list of questions to help people identify whether they have agoraphobia. If you answer yes to most of the questions below, it is likely that you have agoraphobia.</p>\n<p>During the past six months:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do you regularly avoid situations because you are frightened of having a panic attack?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Do any of the following situations make you feel anxious:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>going outside, away from your home</li>\n<li>standing in long lines</li>\n<li>being in a confined space, such as in a tunnel or the underground</li>\n<li>being at home alone</li>\n<li>being in wide open spaces, such as in a field or park</li>\n<li>being in crowded places</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Do you avoid being in any of the above situations?</p>\n<p>If you answer yes to most of these questions, see your GP who will be able to make a formal diagnosis of agoraphobia and provide you with further information and advice.</p>\n<h2>Social phobia</h2>\n<p>Anxiety UK has produced a list of questions to help people identify whether they have social phobia. If you answer yes to most of the questions listed below, it is likely that you have social phobia.</p>\n<p>During the past six months:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do you worry a lot about embarrassing yourself in front of others?</li>\n<li>Do you worry about what people might think of you?</li>\n<li>Do you feel anxious in social situations?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Do you worry about behaving anxiously in any of the following situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>public speaking</li>\n<li>eating and drinking in front of other people</li>\n<li>writing in front of other people</li>\n<li>going to parties and other social gatherings</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Do you avoid any of the above situations because they make you feel anxious?</p>\n<p>If you answer yes to most of these questions, see your GP, who can make a formal diagnosis of social phobia and provide you with further information and advice.</p>\n<p>To diagnose you with social phobia, your GP will need to use the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>your symptoms must be caused by anxiety and not be secondary to other symptoms, such as delusions or obsessions</li>\n<li>the anxiety must be the direct result of being in social situations</li>\n<li>avoiding social situations must be a prominent feature of your condition</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Treatments</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Many people with a phobia do not need treatment and find that avoiding the object of their fear is enough to control the problem.</p>\n<p>However, it may not always be possible to avoid certain phobias, such as a fear of flying. You may want to get professional help and advice to find out about treatment options or you may wish to try self-help techniques.</p>\n<p>Most phobias are curable, but no single treatment is guaranteed to work for all phobias. In some cases, a combination of different treatments may be recommended. The main types of treatment are outlined below.</p>\n<h2>Talking treatments</h2>\n<p>Talking treatments are often very effective for people with phobias. There are several different types of talking therapy:</p>\n<p>Counselling: a trained counsellor listens to your problems, such as feeling anxious in certain situations, and helps you to overcome them.</p>\n<p><a>Psychotherapy</a>: a psychotherapist uses an in-depth approach to find the cause of your problem and suggests ways to deal with it.</p>\n<p>Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT): a type of counselling that explores your thoughts, feelings and behaviour to develop practical ways of effectively dealing with the phobia.</p>\n<p>Speak to your GP to find out if talking treatments would be suitable for you and whether they are available on the NHS in your area.</p>\n<h2>Desensitisation</h2>\n<p>Many simple phobias can be treated using a form of behaviour therapy known as desensitisation or self-exposure therapy. It involves being gradually exposed over a period of time to the object or situation of your fear so that you start to feel less anxious about it.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, a combination of behaviour therapy and medication may be recommended.</p>\n<h2>Medication</h2>\n<p>Medication is not usually recommended for treating phobias because talking therapies are normally successful. However, medication is sometimes prescribed for treating the effects of phobias, such as anxiety.</p>\n<p>Three types of medication are recommended for treating anxiety. The medication used may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a>antidepressants</a></li>\n<li>tranquillisers</li>\n<li>beta-blockers</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Antidepressants</h2>\n<p>Antidepressants are often prescribed to help reduce anxiety. Paroxetine (Seroxat), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is licensed to treat social phobia. Citalopram (Cipramil) and escitalopram (Cipralex) are licensed for the treatment of panic disorder. Venlafaxine (Efexor) is licensed for generalised anxiety disorder (GAD).</p>\n<p>Common side effects of these treatments include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>nausea</li>\n<li>headaches</li>\n<li>sleep problems</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Initially, they may make your anxiety worse.</p>\n<p>Clomipramine (Anafranil) is a type of tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) that is licensed to treat phobias. Side effects include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>dry mouth</li>\n<li>drowsiness</li>\n<li>blurred vision</li>\n<li>tremors (shaking)</li>\n<li>palpitations (irregular heartbeat)</li>\n<li>constipation</li>\n<li>difficulty urinating</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Moclobemide (Manerix) is a type of antidepressant from the monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) group of antidepressants. It is sometimes prescribed to treat social phobia. Moclobemide interacts with certain types of food, so if you are prescribed this medication, read the information leaflet that comes with it to find out which foods you should not eat.</p>\n<p>Other possible side effects include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sleep problems</li>\n<li>dizziness</li>\n<li>stomach problems</li>\n<li>headaches</li>\n<li>restlessness</li>\n<li>agitation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Antidepressants can cause withdrawal symptoms. If you are prescribed antidepressants, it is important that you don\'t stop taking them suddenly. See your GP, who will lower your dose gradually over time.</p>\n<h2>Tranquillisers</h2>\n<p>Benzodiazepines are a group of medicines that are also known as minor tranquillisers. They are sometimes used to treat severe anxiety, but are usually only prescribed in the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible time. This is because they are associated with withdrawal and dependence problems.</p>\n<p>Benzodiazepines are usually only prescribed for a maximum of four weeks at a time. Like antidepressants, their use should be stopped gradually. Benzodiazepines that are often used include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>diazepam (Valium)</li>\n<li>alprazolam (Xanax)</li>\n<li>chlordiazepoxide</li>\n<li>lorazepam (Ativan)</li>\n<li>oxazepam</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Side effects of these medications include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>drowsiness</li>\n<li>tiredness</li>\n<li>confusion</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Two other types of tranquillisers that are licensed to treat severe anxiety are buspirone and meprobamate. Like benzodiazepines, these drugs are only prescribed on a short-term basis.</p>\n<p>The side effects of meprobamate are similar to those of benzodiazepines. The side effects of buspirone include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>nausea</li>\n<li>dizziness</li>\n<li>headaches</li>\n<li>nervousness</li>\n<li>light-headedness</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Beta-blockers</h2>\n<p>Beta-blockers are often used to treat cardiovascular conditions, such as heart problems and high blood pressure (hypertension). They are also sometimes prescribed to help reduce the symptoms of anxiety, such as palpitations (irregular heartbeat).</p>\n<p>Beta-blockers slow down your heart rate and decrease your blood pressure. Propranolol (Inderal) is a beta-blocker that is commonly used to treat anxiety. Side effects include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>stomach problems</li>\n<li>cold fingers</li>\n<li>tiredness</li>\n<li>sleep problems</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>','Phobias','2023-07-09 11:05:43','2023-07-09 11:05:43',NULL),(37,36,NULL,'Postnatal depression','<h1>Postnatal depression:</h1>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Postnatal depression is a type of depression that many parents experience after having a baby.</p>\n<p>It\'s a common problem, affecting more than 1 in every 10 women within a year of giving birth. It can also affect fathers and partners, although this is less common.</p>\n<p>It\'s important to seek help as soon as possible if you think you might be depressed, as your symptoms could last months or get worse and have a significant impact on you, your baby and your family.</p>\n<p>With the right support, which can include self-help strategies and therapy, most women make a full recovery.</p>\n<h2>Symptoms&nbsp;of postnatal depression</h2>\n<p>Many women feel a bit down, tearful or anxious in the first week after giving birth. This is often called the \"baby blues\" and is so common that it&rsquo;s considered normal. The&nbsp;\"baby blues\"&nbsp;don&rsquo;t last for more than two weeks after giving birth.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If your symptoms last longer or start later, you could have postnatal depression. Postnatal depression can start any time in the first year after giving birth.</p>\n<p>Signs that you or someone you know might be depressed include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a persistent feeling of sadness and low mood</li>\n<li>lack of enjoyment and loss of interest in the wider world</li>\n<li>lack of energy and feeling tired all the time</li>\n<li>trouble sleeping at night and feeling sleepy during the day</li>\n<li>difficulty bonding with your baby</li>\n<li>withdrawing from contact with other people</li>\n<li>problems concentrating and making decisions</li>\n<li>frightening thoughts&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;for example, about hurting your baby</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many women don\'t realise they have postnatal depression, because it can develop gradually.</p>\n<h2>Getting help for postnatal depression</h2>\n<p>Speak to your GP or health visitor if you think you may be depressed. Many health visitors have been trained to recognise postnatal depression and have techniques that can help. If they can\'t help, they\'ll know someone in your area who can.</p>\n<p>Encourage your partner to seek help if you think they might be having problems.</p>\n<p>Don\'t struggle alone hoping that the problem will go away.

Some of the factors it has been associated with include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a history of mental health problems, particularly depression, earlier in life</li>\n<li>a history of mental health problems during pregnancy</li>\n<li>having no close family or friends to support you</li>\n<li>a poor relationship with your partner</li>\n<li>recent stressful life events, such as a bereavement</li>\n<li>experiencing the \"baby blues\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even if you don\'t have any of these symptoms, having a baby is a life-changing event that can sometimes trigger depression.</p>\n<p>It often takes time to adapt to becoming a new parent. Looking after a small baby can be stressful and exhausting.</p>\n<h2>Can postnatal depression be prevented?</h2>\n<p>Although there have been several studies into preventing postnatal depression, there is no evidence that there&rsquo;s anything specific you can do to prevent the condition developing, apart from maintaining as healthy a lifestyle as you can for yourself.</p>\n<p>However, if you have a history of depression or mental health problems, or if you have a family history of mental health problems after childbirth, tell your GP or mental health team if you&rsquo;re pregnant or thinking of having a baby. This is so they can offer you appropriate monitoring and treatment, if necessary.</p>\n<p>If you have had a mental health problem while pregnant, your doctor should arrange for you to be seen regularly in the first few weeks after birth.</p>\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Postnatal depression can affect women in different ways. It can start at any point in the first year after giving birth and may develop suddenly or gradually.</p>\n<p>Many women feel a bit down, tearful or anxious in the first week after giving birth. This is often called the \"baby blues\" and is so common that it&rsquo;s considered normal. The \"baby blues\" don&rsquo;t last for more than two weeks after giving birth.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If your symptoms last longer or start later, you could have postnatal depression.</p>\n<h2>Common&nbsp;symptoms of postnatal depression</h2>\n<p>The main symptoms include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a persistent feeling of sadness and low mood</li>\n<li>loss of interest in the world around you and no longer enjoying things that used to give you pleasure</li>\n<li>lack of energy and feeling tired all the time</li>\n<li>trouble sleeping at night and&nbsp;feeling&nbsp;sleepy during the day</li>\n<li>feeling&nbsp;that you\'re unable to look after&nbsp;your baby</li>\n<li>problems concentrating and making decisions</li>\n<li>loss of appetite or an increased appetite (comfort eating)</li>\n<li>feeling agitated, irritable or very apathetic (you \"can\'t be bothered\")</li>\n<li>feelings of guilt, hopelessness and self-blame</li>\n<li>difficulty bonding with your baby with a feeling of indifference and no sense of enjoyment in his or her company</li>\n<li>frightening thoughts&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;for example, about hurting&nbsp;your baby; these can be scary, but they\'re very rarely acted upon</li>\n<li>thinking about&nbsp;<a>suicide</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;self-harm</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These symptoms can affect your day-to-day life and your relationships with your baby, family and friends.</p>\n<p>If you think you may be depressed, talk to your GP or health visitor as soon as possible so you can access the support you need.</p>\n<p>Don\'t struggle on alone and hope the problem will go away.

You should seek help if this is affecting you.</p>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;<a>treating postnatal depression</a>.</p>\n<h2>Spotting the signs in others</h2>\n<p>Postnatal depression can develop gradually and it can be hard to recognise. Some parents may avoid talking to family and friends about how they&rsquo;re feeling because they worry they&rsquo;ll be judged for not coping or not appearing happy.</p>\n<p>Signs for partners, family and friends to look out for in new parents include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>frequently crying for no obvious reason</li>\n<li>having difficulty bonding with their baby, looking after them only as a duty and not wanting to play with them</li>\n<li>withdrawing from contact with other people</li>\n<li>speaking negatively all the time and claiming that they\'re hopeless</li>\n<li>neglecting themselves, such as not washing or changing their clothes</li>\n<li>losing all sense of time, such as being unaware whether 10 minutes or two hours have passed</li>\n<li>losing their sense of humour</li>\n<li>constantly worrying that something is wrong with their baby, regardless of reassurance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you think someone you know is depressed, encourage them to talk about their feelings to you, a friend, their GP or their health visitor.</p>\n<h2>Treatment</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Speak to your GP or health visitor as soon as possible if you think you might have postnatal depression.</p>\n<p>With appropriate treatment and support, most women make a full recovery, although it can take time.</p>\n<p>The three main types of treatment are self-help strategies, therapy and medication, which are all described in more detail below. Talk to your GP about the pros and cons of different treatments so you can decide together what&rsquo;s best for you.</p>\n<p>Your GP might also want to check your physical health to see if there are any problems that may need to be addressed as well. For instance, you may be anaemic after having given birth and that could add to any feelings of depression you might have.</p>\n<h2>Self-help</h2>\n<p>Looking after a baby can be stressful and challenging for anyone, and it can be even tougher if you\'re dealing with postnatal depression as well.</p>\n<p>There are a number of things you can try yourself to improve your symptoms and help you cope. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>talk to your partner, friends and family &ndash; try to help them understand how you\'re feeling and what they can do to support you</li>\n<li>don\'t try to be a \"supermum\" &ndash; accept help from others when it\'s offered and ask your loved ones if they can help look after the baby and do tasks such as housework, cooking and shopping</li>\n<li>make time for yourself &ndash; try to do activities that you find relaxing and enjoyable, such as going for a walk, listening to music, reading a book or having a warm bath</li>\n<li>rest when you can &ndash; although it can be difficult when you&rsquo;re looking after a baby, try to sleep whenever you get the chance, follow&nbsp;<a>good sleeping habits</a>&nbsp;and ask your partner to help with the night-time work</li>\n<li>exercise regularly &ndash; this has been shown to help boost mood in people with mild depression</li>\n<li>eat regular,&nbsp;<a>healthy meals</a>&nbsp;and don\'t go for long periods without eating</li>\n<li>don\'t drink&nbsp;<a>alcohol</a>&nbsp;or take drugs, as this can make you feel worse</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ask your health visitor about support services in your area. They may be able to put you in touch with a social worker, counsellor or local support group. It can be reassuring to meet other women who are going through something similar.</p>\n<p><a>Find postnatal depression support and information in your area</a>.</p>\n<h2>Psychological treatments</h2>\n<p>Psychological therapies are usually the first treatment recommended for women with postnatal depression.</p>\n<p>The main types used are described below.</p>\n<h3>Guided self-help</h3>\n<p>Guided self-help involves working through a book or an&nbsp;online course on your own or with some help from a therapist.</p>\n<p>The course materials focus on the issues you might be facing, with practical advice on how to deal with them.</p>\n<p>The courses typically last 9 to 12 weeks.</p>\n<h3>Cognitive behavioural therapy</h3>\n<p>Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a type of therapy based on the idea that unhelpful and unrealistic thinking leads to negative behaviour.</p>\n<p>CBT aims to break this cycle and find new ways of thinking that can help you behave in a more positive way.</p>\n<p>For example, some women have unrealistic expectations about what being a mum is like and feel they should never make mistakes. As part of CBT, you\'ll be encouraged to see that these thoughts are unhelpful and discuss ways to think more positively.</p>\n<p>CBT can be carried out either one-to-one with a therapist or in a group. Treatment will often last three to four months.</p>\n<h3>Interpersonal therapy</h3>\n<p>Interpersonal therapy (IPT) involves talking to a therapist about the problems you\'re experiencing.</p>\n<p>It aims to identify problems in your relationships with family, friends or partners and how they might relate to your feelings of depression.</p>\n<p>Treatment also usually lasts three to four months.</p>\n<h2>Antidepressants</h2>\n<p><a>Antidepressants</a>&nbsp;may be recommended if you have moderate or severe depression and you don\'t want to try psychological treatment or psychological treatment&nbsp;doesn\'t help.</p>\n<p>They may also be used if you have mild postnatal depression and a previous history of depression.</p>\n<p>Antidepressants work by balancing mood-altering chemicals in your brain.&nbsp;They can help ease symptoms such as low mood, irritability, lack of concentration and sleeplessness, allowing you to function normally and helping you&nbsp;cope better with your new baby.</p>\n<p>Antidepressants usually need to be taken for at least a week before the benefit starts to be felt, so it\'s important to keep taking them even if you don\'t notice an improvement straight away. You\'ll usually need to take them for around six months after you start to feel better. If you stop too early, your depression may return.</p>\n<h3>Antidepressants and breastfeeding</h3>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re breastfeeding, talk to your doctor about suitable medicines, as not all antidepressants are safe to take while breastfeeding.</p>\n<p>Your doctor should explain any risks of taking antidepressants and you should be offered the type with the least risk for you and your baby.</p>\n<h3>Side effects</h3>\n<p>General&nbsp;<a>side effects of&nbsp;antidepressants</a>&nbsp;include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>feeling sick</li>\n<li>blurred vision</li>\n<li>a&nbsp;<a>dry mouth</a></li>\n<li><a>constipation</a></li>\n<li>dizziness&nbsp;</li>\n<li>feeling agitated or shaky</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These side effects should pass once your body gets used to the medication.</p>\n<h2>Severe postnatal depression</h2>\n<p>If your postnatal depression is very severe and it doesn\'t respond to the treatments above, you\'ll probably be&nbsp;referred to a specialist mental health team.</p>\n<p>Your&nbsp;team will be able to try additional treatments, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>more intensive CBT</li>\n<li>other psychological treatments, such as&nbsp;<a>psychotherapy</a></li>\n<li>therapies such as baby massage to help you bond better with your baby, if this has become a problem</li>\n<li>different medications</li>\n<li>electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)&nbsp;&ndash; where electrodes are placed on your head and pulses of electricity are sent through&nbsp;the brain, which may improve your mood by changing the balance of chemicals in your brain</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If it\'s thought that your depression is so severe that you\'re at risk of harming yourself or others, you may be admitted to hospital or a mental health clinic.</p>\n<p>Your baby can either be looked after by your partner or family until you\'re well enough to return home, or you can stay in a specialised&nbsp;<a>\"mother and baby\" mental health unit</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>','Postnatal depression','2023-07-09 11:05:43','2023-07-09 11:05:43',NULL),(38,37,NULL,'Problem gambling','<h1>Problem gambling:</h1>\n<p>Problem gambling is defined as gambling that is disruptive or damaging to you or your family, or interferes with your daily life.&nbsp;<a>Most people in the UK gambled or played the lottery in the last year</a>&nbsp;- activities like playing the lottery once or twice a week aren&rsquo;t harmful.

You should get help as soon as possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Effects of problem gambling</h2>\n<p>While problem gambling itself doesn&rsquo;t have physical symptoms, the negative effects can appear in many areas of life. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>reduced quality of life &ndash; having less money or free time</li>\n<li>problems with your social life &ndash; avoiding seeing friends or going out</li>\n<li>physical illnesses caused by spending more time gambling and less time being active, as well as potentially drinking more alcohol</li>\n<li>financial problems &ndash; running up debts, and not having enough money for essentials</li>\n<li>relationship problems and conflict at home &ndash; this can include arguments with family and friends, or conflict with your partner about financial difficulties</li>\n<li>criminal activity &ndash; problem gambling doesn&rsquo;t make you a criminal, but some people find themselves committing crimes to fund their gambling habit</li>\n<li>unemployment or difficulties at work &ndash; if you gamble at work, or miss work due to gambling, it can lead to issues at work and potentially unemployment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even if you haven&rsquo;t experienced any of these issues yet, if your gambling is becoming a problem it&rsquo;s possible these negative effects will happen in the future. It&rsquo;s important to be mindful of the impact gambling could have on you or your family.</p>\n<h2>How problem gambling happens</h2>\n<p>Some people seem to be more likely to develop a gambling problem than others.</p>\n<p>Men tend to be more vulnerable to developing a gambling problem than women, likely because&nbsp;<a>women usually gamble less than men</a>.</p>\n<p>While a gambling problem can start at any age, people who start as teenagers or young adults can grow into problem gamblers. Children as young as 7 can struggle to control how much time they spend playing video and mobile games, many of which ask for micro-transactions and payments. Older people who feel isolated or bored can also be attracted to gambling.</p>\n<p>People who work in casinos, betting shops or arcades can be more likely to develop a gambling habit.</p>\n<p>Certain types of gambling can be more likely to lead to a problem than others:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>mobile or internet gambling &ndash; like betting or bingo websites and apps</li>\n<li>video poker</li>\n<li>roulette</li>\n<li>dice games</li>\n<li>the stock market</li>\n<li>playing sports for money</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Engaging in these activities doesn\'t mean you have a problem with gambling, but it&rsquo;s important to be aware that these types of gambling are particularly addictive.</p>\n<h2>Things that could make problem gambling more likely</h2>\n<p>There are some factors that can make a person more vulnerable to developing a gambling problem. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>having a mental health condition</li>\n<li>having an alcohol or drug problem</li>\n<li>being in prison</li>\n<li>having a family member, particularly a parent, with a gambling addiction</li>\n<li>a gambling habit that started early &ndash; some people start gambling as young as 7 or 8</li>\n<li>having trouble controlling your gambling from the first time you did it, even if you don&rsquo;t actually gamble very often</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean that everyone in these circumstances will develop a problem, but it&rsquo;s important to be aware of the risk if gambling is something you do.</p>\n<h2>Self-help for problem gambling</h2>\n<p>If you feel your gambling has become a problem, there are steps you can take right away to start improving your situation.</p>\n<h3>1. Limit how much money you can spend gambling</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay all your essential bills, like rent/mortgage, utilities, council tax, food, and childcare costs, as soon as you get paid.</li>\n<li>Set yourself a weekly limit on how much you&rsquo;re willing to spend on gambling, and be sure to stick to it.</li>\n<li>If you go out to gamble, leave your debit and credit cards at home and only take cash, so you can&rsquo;t spend more than planned.</li>\n<li>On gambling websites and apps, set a limit on your account so you can&rsquo;t overspend.</li>\n<li>Talk to your bank about blocking certain websites or locations, like betting websites or casinos.</li>\n<li>Use&nbsp;<a>GAMSTOP</a>&nbsp;to block yourself from accessing online gambling sites and gambling apps. GAMSTOP doesn&rsquo;t cover every site or app operating in the UK, but you can contact ones you use that aren&rsquo;t signed up to this scheme and ask them to block you.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Reduce the time you spend gambling</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Set a limit on how often you gamble in a week. Be specific and name the days &ndash; for example: &ldquo;I will only gamble on Tuesdays and Fridays.&rdquo;</li>\n<li>Resist the temptation to open up gambling sites or apps for a &lsquo;quick go&rsquo; or just to make one bet &ndash; it&rsquo;s likely that you&rsquo;ll find it hard to stick to just one.</li>\n<li>Set alarms or alerts on your phone, watch, or computer to remind you when it&rsquo;s time to close the site or app and stop gambling for the day.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3. Don&rsquo;t think of gambling as a way to make money</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Remind yourself frequently that gambling isn&rsquo;t a way to make money &ndash; you&rsquo;re paying for entertainment. It&rsquo;s not an investment, and you&rsquo;re not earning money by gambling.</li>\n<li>When you gamble, always prepare yourself to lose. Remind yourself that winning is by chance, and not something that happens more often than losing.</li>\n<li>Never spend money from savings or investments on gambling.</li>\n<li>Tell your friends and family not to lend you money if you ask.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>4. Fill up your time with other things</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend more time with friends and family.</li>\n<li>Spend less time with people you know who gamble, or people you usually gamble with.</li>\n<li>Join clubs or social groups that don&rsquo;t involve gambling &ndash; this could be a good time to take up a new hobby, or restart one you haven&rsquo;t done for a while.</li>\n<li>Talk to friends and family about your situation and your concerns, rather than &lsquo;bottling up&rsquo; your feelings.</li>\n</ul>','Problem gambling','2023-07-09 11:05:43','2023-07-09 11:05:43',NULL),(39,38,NULL,'Allergic rhinitis','<h1>Allergic rhinitis:</h1>\n<h2>About allergic rhinitis</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Allergic rhinitis is inflammation of the inside of the nose caused by an allergen, such as pollen, dust, mould, or flakes of skin from certain animals.</p>\n<p>It\'s a very common condition, estimated to affect around one in every five people in the UK.</p>\n<h2>Signs and symptoms</h2>\n<p>Allergic rhinitis&nbsp;typically&nbsp;causes&nbsp;<a>cold-like symptoms</a>, such as sneezing, itchiness and a blocked or runny nose. These symptoms usually&nbsp;start soon after being&nbsp;exposed to an allergen.</p>\n<p>Some people only&nbsp;get allergic rhinitis&nbsp;for a few months at a time because they\'re sensitive to seasonal allergens, such as&nbsp;tree or grass pollen. Other people get allergic rhinitis all year round.</p>\n<p>Most people with allergic rhinitis have mild symptoms that can be easily and effectively treated. But for some symptoms can be severe and persistent, causing sleep problems and interfering with everyday life.</p>\n<p>The symptoms of allergic rhinitis occasionally improve with time, but this can take many years and&nbsp;it\'s unlikely that the condition will disappear completely.</p>\n<h2>When to see your GP</h2>\n<p>Visit your GP if the symptoms of allergic rhinitis are disrupting your sleep, preventing you carrying out everyday activities, or adversely affecting your performance at work or school.</p>\n<p>A diagnosis of allergic rhinitis will usually be based on your symptoms and any possible triggers you may have noticed. If the cause of your condition is uncertain, you may be referred for&nbsp;<a>allergy testing</a>.</p>\n<h2>What causes allergic rhinitis?</h2>\n<p>Allergic rhinitis is caused by the&nbsp;immune system reacting to an allergen as if&nbsp;it&nbsp;were harmful.</p>\n<p>This&nbsp;results&nbsp;in&nbsp;cells releasing a number of chemicals that cause&nbsp;the inside layer of your nose (the mucous membrane) to become swollen and excessive levels of mucus to be produced.</p>\n<p>Common&nbsp;allergens that cause allergic rhinitis include pollen&nbsp;&ndash; this type of allergic rhinitis is known as&nbsp;<a>hay fever</a>&nbsp;&ndash; as well as&nbsp;mould spores, house dust mites, and&nbsp;flakes of skin or droplets of urine or&nbsp;saliva from certain&nbsp;animals.</p>\n<p>Read more about the&nbsp;<a>causes of allergic rhinitis</a></p>\n<h2>Treating and preventing allergic rhinitis</h2>\n<p>It\'s difficult to completely avoid potential allergens, but you can take steps to reduce exposure to a particular allergen you know or suspect is triggering your allergic rhinitis. This will help improve your symptoms.</p>\n<p>If&nbsp;your condition is mild, you can also help reduce the symptoms by taking over-the-counter medications, such as non-sedating antihistamines, and by regularly rinsing your nasal passages with a salt water solution to keep your nose free of irritants.</p>\n<p>See your GP for advice if you\'ve tried taking&nbsp;these steps and they haven\'t helped. They may prescribe a stronger medication, such as a nasal spray containing&nbsp;<a>corticosteroids</a>.</p>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;<a>treating allergic rhinitis</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a>preventing allergic rhinitis</a></p>\n<h2>Further problems</h2>\n<p>Allergic rhinitis can lead to complications in some cases. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>nasal polyps &ndash; abnormal but non-cancerous (benign) sacs of fluid that grow inside the nasal passages and sinuses</li>\n<li><a>sinusitis</a>&nbsp;&ndash; an infection caused by nasal inflammation and swelling that prevents mucus draining from the sinuses</li>\n<li><a>middle ear infections</a>&nbsp;&ndash; infection of part of the ear located directly behind the eardrum</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These problems can often be treated with medication, although surgery is sometimes needed in severe or long-term cases.</p>\n<h2>Causes of allergic rhinitis</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Allergic rhinitis is caused by an allergic reaction to an allergen, such as pollen, dust and certain animals.</p>\n<h2>Oversensitive immune system</h2>\n<p>If you have allergic rhinitis, your immune system&nbsp;&ndash; your natural defence against infection and illness&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;will react to an allergen as if it were harmful.</p>\n<p>If your immune system is oversensitive, it will react to allergens by producing antibodies to fight them off. Antibodies are special proteins in the blood that are usually produced to fight viruses and infections.</p>\n<p>Allergic reactions don\'t occur the first time you come into contact with an allergen. The immune system has to recognise and \"memorise\" it before producing antibodies to fight&nbsp;it. This process is&nbsp;known as sensitisation.</p>\n<p>After you develop sensitivity to an allergen, it will be detected by antibodies called immunoglobulin E (IgE)&nbsp;whenever&nbsp;it comes into contact with the inside of your nose and throat.</p>\n<p>These antibodies cause cells to release a number of chemicals, including histamine, which can cause&nbsp;the inside layer of your nose (the mucous membrane) to become inflamed and produce excess mucus. This is what causes the typical symptoms of sneezing and a blocked or runny nose.</p>\n<h2>Common allergens</h2>\n<p>Allergic rhinitis is triggered by breathing in tiny particles of allergens. The most common airborne allergens that cause rhinitis are described below.</p>\n<h3>House dust mites</h3>\n<p>House dust mites are tiny insects that feed on the dead flakes of human skin. They can be found in mattresses, carpets, soft furniture, pillows and beds.</p>\n<p>Rhinitis isn\'t caused by the dust mites themselves, but by&nbsp;a chemical found in their excrement. Dust mites&nbsp;are present all year round, although their numbers tend to peak during the winter.</p>\n<h3>Pollen and spores</h3>\n<p>Tiny particles of pollen produced by trees and grasses can sometimes cause allergic rhinitis. Most trees pollinate&nbsp;from early to mid-spring, whereas grasses pollinate at the end of spring and beginning of summer.</p>\n<p>Rhinitis can also be caused by spores produced by mould and fungi.</p>\n<h3>Animals</h3>\n<p>Many people are allergic to animals, such as cats and dogs. The allergic reaction isn\'t caused by animal fur, but flakes of dead animal skin and&nbsp;their urine and saliva.</p>\n<p>Dogs and cats are the most common culprits, although some people are affected by horses, cattle, rabbits and rodents, such as guinea pigs and hamsters.</p>\n<p>However,&nbsp;being around dogs from an early age can help protect against allergies, and there\'s some evidence to suggest that this might also be the case with cats.</p>\n<h3>Work-related allergens</h3>\n<p>Some people are affected by allergens found in their work environment, such as wood dust, flour dust or latex.</p>\n<h2>Who\'s most at risk?</h2>\n<p>It isn\'t fully understood why some people become oversensitive to allergens, although you\'re more likely to develop an allergy&nbsp;if there\'s a history of allergies in your family.</p>\n<p>If this is the case, you\'re said to be \"atopic\", or to have \"atopy\". People who are atopic&nbsp;have a genetic tendency to develop allergic conditions. Their increased immune response to allergens results in increased production of IgE antibodies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Environmental factors may also play a&nbsp;part. Studies have shown certain things may&nbsp;increase the chance of a child developing allergies, such as growing up in a house where people smoke and being exposed to&nbsp;dust mites at a young age.</p>\n<h2>Diagnosing allergic rhinitis</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Your GP will often be able to diagnose allergic rhinitis from your symptoms and your personal and family medical history.</p>\n<p>They\'ll ask you whether you\'ve noticed&nbsp;any triggers that seem to cause a reaction, and whether it happens at a particular place or time.</p>\n<p>Your GP may examine the inside of your nose to check for nasal polyps.</p>\n<p>Nasal polyps are fleshy swellings that grow from the lining of your nose or your sinuses, the small cavities inside your nose. They can be caused by the inflammation that occurs as a result of allergic rhinitis.</p>\n<p>Allergic rhinitis is usually confirmed when medical treatment starts. If you respond well to antihistamines, it\'s almost certain that your symptoms are caused by an allergy.</p>\n<h2>Allergy testing</h2>\n<p>If the exact cause of allergic rhinitis is uncertain, your GP may refer you to a hospital allergy clinic for allergy testing.</p>\n<p>The two main allergy tests are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>skin prick test &ndash;&nbsp;where the allergen is placed on your arm and the surface of the skin&nbsp;is pricked with a needle to&nbsp;introduce the allergen to your immune system; if you\'re allergic to the substance,&nbsp;a small itchy spot (welt) will appear</li>\n<li>blood test &ndash;&nbsp;to check for the immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody in your blood; your immune system produces this antibody&nbsp;in response to a suspected allergen</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Commercial allergy testing kits&nbsp;aren\'t recommended because the testing is often of a lower standard than that provided by the NHS or an accredited private clinic.</p>\n<p>It\'s also&nbsp;important that the test results are interpreted by a qualified healthcare professional with detailed knowledge of your symptoms and medical history.</p>\n<h2>Further tests</h2>\n<p>In some cases further&nbsp;hospital tests may be needed to check for complications, such as nasal polyps or&nbsp;<a>sinusitis</a>.</p>\n<p>For example, you may need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a nasal endoscopy&nbsp;&ndash; where a&nbsp;thin tube with a light source and video camera at one end (endoscope) is inserted up your nose so your doctor can see inside your nose</li>\n<li>a nasal inspiratory flow test &ndash; where a small device is placed over your mouth and nose to&nbsp;measure the air flow when you inhale through your nose</li>\n<li>a&nbsp;<a>computerised tomography (CT) scan</a>&nbsp;&ndash; a scan that uses&nbsp;<a>X-rays</a>&nbsp;and a computer to create detailed images of the inside of the body</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Treating allergic rhinitis</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Treatment for allergic rhinitis depends on how severe your symptoms are and how much they\'re affecting your everyday activities.</p>\n<p>In most cases treatment aims to relieve symptoms such as sneezing and a blocked or runny nose.</p>\n<p>If you have mild allergic rhinitis, you can often treat the symptoms yourself.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You should visit your GP if your symptoms are more severe and affecting your quality of life,&nbsp;or if self-help measures haven\'t been effective.</p>\n<h2>Self-help</h2>\n<p>It\'s possible to treat the symptoms of mild allergic rhinitis with over-the-counter medications, such as long-acting, non-sedating antihistamines.</p>\n<p>If possible, try to reduce exposure to the allergen that triggers the condition. See&nbsp;<a>preventing allergic rhinitis</a>&nbsp;for more information and advice about this.</p>\n<h3>Cleaning your nasal passages</h3>\n<p>Regularly cleaning your nasal passages with a salt water solution&nbsp;&ndash; known as nasal douching or irrigation&nbsp;&ndash; can also help by keeping your nose free of irritants.</p>\n<p>You can do this either by using a homemade solution or a solution made with sachets of ingredients bought from a pharmacy.</p>\n<p>Small syringes or pots that often look like small horns or teapots are also available to help flush the solution around the inside of your nose.</p>\n<p>To make the solution at home, mix half a teaspoon of salt and&nbsp;half a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda (baking powder) into a pint (568ml) of boiled water that\'s been left to cool to around body temperature&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;do not attempt to rinse your nose while the water is still hot.</p>\n<p>To rinse your nose:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>stand over a sink, cup the palm of one hand and pour a small amount of the solution into it</li>\n<li>sniff the water into one nostril at a time</li>\n<li>repeat this until your nose feels comfortable&nbsp;&ndash; you may not need to use all of the solution</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While you do this, some solution may pass into your throat through the back of your nose. The solution is harmless if swallowed, but try to spit out as much of it as possible.</p>\n<p>Nasal irrigation can be carried out as often as necessary, but a fresh solution should be made each time.</p>\n<h2>Medication</h2>\n<p>Medication won\'t cure your allergy, but it can be used to treat the common symptoms.</p>\n<p>If your symptoms are caused by seasonal allergens, such as pollen, you should be able to stop taking your medication after the risk of exposure has passed.</p>\n<p>Visit&nbsp;your GP if your symptoms don\'t respond to medication after two weeks.</p>\n<h3>Antihistamines</h3>\n<p>Antihistamines relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis by blocking the action of a chemical called histamine, which the body releases when it thinks it\'s under attack from an allergen.</p>\n<p>You can buy antihistamine tablets over the counter from your pharmacist without a prescription, but antihistamine nasal sprays are only available with a prescription.</p>\n<p>Antihistamines can sometimes&nbsp;cause drowsiness. If you\'re taking them for the first time, see how you react to them before driving or operating heavy machinery. In particular, antihistamines can cause drowsiness if you drink alcohol while taking them.</p>\n<h3>Corticosteroids</h3>\n<p>If you have frequent or persistent&nbsp;symptoms and you have a nasal blockage or nasal polyps, your GP may recommend a nasal spray or drops containing&nbsp;<a>corticosteroids</a>.</p>\n<p>Corticosteroids help reduce inflammation and swelling. They take longer to work than antihistamines, but their effects last longer. Side effects from inhaled corticosteroids are rare, but can include nasal dryness, irritation and&nbsp;<a>nosebleeds</a>.</p>\n<p>If you&nbsp;have a particularly severe bout of symptoms and need rapid relief, your GP&nbsp;may prescribe a short course of corticosteroid tablets lasting&nbsp;5 to 10 days.</p>\n<h3>Add-on treatments</h3>\n<p>If allergic rhinitis doesn\'t respond to treatment,&nbsp;your GP&nbsp;may choose to&nbsp;add to your original treatment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They may&nbsp;suggest:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>increasing the dose of your corticosteroid nasal spray</li>\n<li>using a short-term course of a decongestant nasal spray to take with your other medication</li>\n<li>combining antihistamine tablets with corticosteroid nasal sprays, and possibly decongestants</li>\n<li>using a nasal spray&nbsp;that contains a medicine called ipratropium, which will help reduce excessive nasal discharge</li>\n<li>using a leukotriene receptor antagonist medication &ndash; medication that blocks the effects of chemicals called&nbsp;leukotrienes, which are released during an allergic reaction</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you don\'t respond to the add-on treatments, you may be referred to a specialist for further assessment and treatment.</p>\n<h2>Immunotherapy</h2>\n<p>Immunotherapy, also known as hyposensitisation or desensitisation,&nbsp;is another type&nbsp;of treatment used for some allergies.</p>\n<p>It\'s only suitable for people with certain types of allergies, such as&nbsp;<a>hay fever</a>, and&nbsp;is&nbsp;usually only considered if your symptoms&nbsp;are severe.</p>\n<p>Immunotherapy involves&nbsp;gradually introducing more and more of the allergen into your body to make&nbsp;your immune system&nbsp;less sensitive to it.</p>\n<p>The allergen is&nbsp;often injected under the skin of your upper arm. Injections are given at weekly intervals, with a slightly increased dose each time.</p>\n<p>Immunotherapy can also be carried out&nbsp;using tablets that contain&nbsp;an allergen, such as grass pollen, which&nbsp;are&nbsp;placed under your tongue.</p>\n<p>When a dose is reached that\'s effective&nbsp;in reducing your allergic reaction (the maintenance dose), you\'ll need to continue with the injections or tablets for up to three&nbsp;years.</p>\n<p>Immunotherapy should only be carried out under the close supervision of a specially trained doctor as there\'s a risk it may cause a serious allergic reaction.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>','Allergic rhinitis','2023-07-09 11:05:43','2023-07-09 11:05:43',NULL),(40,39,NULL,'Earache','<h1>Earache:</h1>\n<h2>About earache</h2>\n<div >\n<p>Earache is a common problem, particularly in children.

These can help soften the earwax so that it falls out naturally.</p>\n<p>There are several different types of eardrops you can use, including drops containing sodium bicarbonate, olive oil or almond oil.</p>\n<p>However, eardrops aren\'t suitable for everyone and&nbsp;some can&nbsp;irritate the skin. For example, eardrops shouldn\'t be used&nbsp;if you have a perforated eardrum&nbsp;(a hole or tear in&nbsp;your eardrum).</p>\n<p>Speak to your pharmacist about the most suitable product for you and make sure you read the leaflet that comes with it.</p>\n<h2>When to see your GP</h2>\n<p>Contact your GP surgery if you have particularly troublesome symptoms or eardrops haven\'t helped after three to five days.</p>\n<p>Your GP or practice nurse will look inside your ears to check if they\'re blocked and might carry out some simple hearing tests.</p>\n<p>They may suggest using eardrops for a bit longer, or they may carry out a minor procedure called ear irrigation to clean out your ear canal.</p>\n<p>If these treatments aren\'t suitable or don\'t help, your GP may refer you to the ENT department of your nearest hospital for more specialised treatments such as microsuction or an aural toilet.</p>\n<h2>Treatments to remove earwax</h2>\n<p>There are several different earwax removal treatments available.</p>\n<p>The main treatments are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>eardrops &ndash; drops&nbsp;used several times a day for a few days to soften the earwax so that it falls out by itself</li>\n<li>ear irrigation &ndash; a quick and painless procedure where an electric pump is used to push water into your ear and wash the earwax out</li>\n<li>microsuction &ndash; a quick and painless procedure where a small device is used to suck the earwax out of your ear</li>\n<li>aural toilet &ndash; where a thin instrument with a small&nbsp;hoop at one end is used to clean your ear and scrape out the earwax</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Not all these treatments are suitable for everyone. Your pharmacist or doctor can let you know what treatments may work for you and they can tell you about any associated risks or side effects.</p>\n<h2>Preventing an earwax build-up</h2>\n<p>Some people are naturally prone to earwax building up in their ears and may need frequent treatment to remove it when it becomes a problem.</p>\n<p>It\'s not clear if there\'s anything you can do to&nbsp;stop earwax blocking your ears, although some doctors recommend using eardrops regularly to keep your earwax soft.</p>\n<p>Don\'t try to scrape out the earwax with your finger or an object inserted into your ear, as this this can make the problem worse.</p>\n<p>Speak to your doctor for advice if earwax builds up in your ears regularly.</p>\n</div>\n</div>','Earwax build-up','2023-07-09 11:05:43','2023-07-09 11:05:43',NULL),(42,41,NULL,'Hearing loss','<h1 >Hearing loss:</h1>\n<h2>About hearing loss</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Hearing loss is a common problem that often develops with age or is caused by repeated exposure to loud noises.</p>\n<p><a>Action on Hearing Loss</a>&nbsp;estimates that there are more than 10 million (about 1 in 6) people in the UK&nbsp;with some degree of hearing impairment&nbsp;or deafness.</p>\n<p>Hearing loss can occur suddenly, but usually develops gradually. General signs of hearing loss can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>difficulty hearing other people clearly and misunderstanding what they say</li>\n<li>asking people to repeat themselves</li>\n<li>listening to music or watching television with the volume turned up higher than other people require</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>When to see your GP</h2>\n<p>See your GP if you\'re having problems with your hearing, or your child is showing signs of hearing difficulty.&nbsp;If you lose your hearing suddenly, in one or both ears,&nbsp;you must see your GP as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Your GP can check for any problems and may refer you to an audiologist (hearing specialist) or an ENT surgeon&nbsp;for further tests.</p>\n<p>You can also visit the Action on Hearing Loss website for an&nbsp;<a>online hearing test.</a></p>\n<h2>Why it happens</h2>\n<p>Hearing loss is the result of sound signals not reaching the brain. There are&nbsp;two&nbsp;main types of hearing loss, depending on where the problem lies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sensorineural hearing loss&nbsp;&ndash; caused&nbsp;by damage to the sensitive hair cells inside the inner ear or damage to the auditory nerve; this occurs naturally with age or as a result of injury</li>\n<li>conductive hearing loss &ndash; when sounds are unable to pass from your outer ear to your inner ear, often because of a blockage such as&nbsp;<a>earwax</a>,&nbsp;glue ear&nbsp;or a build-up of fluid from an&nbsp;<a>ear infection</a>, or because of a&nbsp;perforated ear drum or disorder of the hearing bones</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It\'s also possible to have both these types of hearing loss. This is known as mixed hearing loss.</p>\n<p>Some&nbsp;people are born with hearing loss, but most cases develop as you get older.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Preventing hearing loss</h2>\n<p>It isn\'t always possible to prevent hearing loss if you have an underlying condition that causes you to lose your hearing.</p>\n<p>However, there are several&nbsp;things you can&nbsp;do&nbsp;to&nbsp;reduce the risk of hearing loss from long-term exposure to&nbsp;loud noise. This includes not having music or the television on at a&nbsp;loud volume at home and using&nbsp;ear protection at loud music events or in noisy work environments.</p>\n<p>You should also see&nbsp;your GP if&nbsp;you have signs of an ear infection, such as&nbsp;<a >flu</a>-like symptoms, severe&nbsp;<a>earache</a>, discharge&nbsp;or hearing loss.</p>\n<h2>Treating hearing&nbsp;loss</h2>\n<p>The way hearing&nbsp;loss is treated depends on&nbsp;the cause and how severe it is.</p>\n<p>In cases of sensorineural hearing loss, there are several options that may help to improve a person&rsquo;s ability to hear and communicate. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>digital&nbsp;hearing aids &ndash; which are&nbsp;available through the NHS</li>\n<li>bone anchored implants &ndash;&nbsp;suitable for&nbsp;people who are unable to use hearing aids and for some levels of sensorineural hearing loss</li>\n<li>middle ear implants &ndash; suitable for&nbsp;some people who are unable to use hearing aids</li>\n<li>cochlear implants &ndash; for people who find hearing aids aren\'t powerful enough</li>\n<li>lip reading and/or sign language &ndash; such as British Sign Language (BSL)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Conductive hearing loss is sometimes temporary and can be treated with medication or minor surgery, if necessary. However, more major surgery may be required to fix the ear drum or hearing bones. If conventional hearing aids don\'t work, there are also some implantable devices for this type of hearing loss, such as a Bone Anchored Hearing Aids (BAHAs).</p>\n<h2>Signs of hearing loss</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Hearing loss is sometimes sudden, but often it\'s gradual and you may not notice it at first. Being aware of the early signs can help you identify the problem quickly.</p>\n<p>It\'s important to spot hearing loss&nbsp;as soon as possible, because treatment is often more beneficial if started early.</p>\n<h2>General signs of hearing loss</h2>\n<p>Early signs of hearing loss can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>difficulty hearing other people clearly and misunderstanding what they say, especially in group situations</li>\n<li>asking&nbsp;people to repeat themselves</li>\n<li>listening to music or watching television with the volume higher than other people need</li>\n<li>difficulty hearing the telephone or doorbell</li>\n<li>finding it difficult to tell which direction noise is coming from</li>\n<li>regularly feeling tired or stressed,&nbsp;from having to concentrate while listening</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In some cases, you may&nbsp;recognise signs of hearing loss in someone else before they&nbsp;notice it themselves.&nbsp;Research suggests it takes 10 years from the time someone notices they have hearing loss, before they do anything about it.</p>\n<p>If you also hear a ringing, buzzing or whistling sound in your ears, this could be a sign of&nbsp;<a>tinnitus</a>, which is often associated with hearing loss.</p>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;<a>losing your hearing</a></p>\n<h2>Signs of hearing&nbsp;loss in children</h2>\n<p>Babies are routinely screened within the first few weeks of their birth as part of the Newborn Hearing Screening Programme (NHSP). However, there are signs&nbsp;you can&nbsp;look&nbsp;out for&nbsp;which may suggest you should see&nbsp;your GP&nbsp;to arrange&nbsp;another hearing test.</p>\n<h3>Signs in babies</h3>\n<p>You should consider seeing your GP if you notice that your&nbsp;baby or toddler:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>isn\'t startled&nbsp;by loud noises</li>\n<li>doesn\'t turn towards the source of a sound&nbsp;while under&nbsp;four&nbsp;months old</li>\n<li>doesn\'t say single words by the time they\'re one year old</li>\n<li>notices&nbsp;you when they see you, but not when you call their name</li>\n<li>hears some sounds but not others</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Signs in children</h3>\n<p>You should consider seeing your GP if you notice that your child:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>is slow to&nbsp;learn to talk, or they\'re not clear when they speak&nbsp;</li>\n<li>often asks you to repeat yourself or responds inappropriately to a question</li>\n<li>doesn\'t reply when you call them</li>\n<li>often talks very loudly</li>\n<li>often turns up the volume of the TV so it\'s very loud</li>\n<li>watches other people to copy instructions, because they haven\'t heard</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Seeking medical help</h2>\n<p>Make an appointment to see your GP if you\'re having problems with your hearing, or your child is showing signs of hearing difficulties.</p>\n<p>If&nbsp;you wake up&nbsp;with a sudden loss of hearing in one ear or lose the hearing in one ear within a couple of days, you&nbsp;should see&nbsp;your GP as soon as possible.</p>\n<h2>Causes of hearing loss</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Hearing loss is the result of sound signals not reaching the brain. There are two main types of hearing loss, depending on where the problem lies.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sensorineural hearing loss is caused by damage to the sensitive hair cells inside the inner ear or damage to the auditory nerve. This occurs naturally with age or as a result of injury.</li>\n<li>Conductive hearing loss&nbsp;happens when sounds are unable to pass from your outer ear to your inner ear, often because of a blockage such as earwax or&nbsp;glue ear.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These causes are explained below.</p>\n<h2>Age</h2>\n<p>Age is the biggest single cause of&nbsp;hearing loss. Hearing loss that develops as a result of getting older is often known as age-related hearing loss or presbycusis.</p>\n<p>Most people begin to lose a small amount of their hearing&nbsp;from around&nbsp;40 years&nbsp;of age. This hearing loss increases as you get older. By the age of 80, most people have significant hearing problems.</p>\n<p>As your hearing starts to deteriorate, high-frequency sounds, such as female or children&rsquo;s voices, may become difficult to hear. It may also be harder to hear consonants such as \"s\", \"f\" and \"th\". This can make understanding speech in background noise very difficult.</p>\n<h2>Loud noises</h2>\n<p>Another common cause of hearing loss is damage to the ear from repeated exposure to loud noises over time. This is known as noise-induced hearing loss, and it occurs when the sensitive hair cells inside the cochlea become damaged.</p>\n<p>You\'re at higher risk of developing noise-induced hearing loss if you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>work with noisy equipment, such as pneumatic drills or compressed-air hammers</li>\n<li>work in environments where there\'s loud music, such as a nightclub</li>\n<li>regularly listen to music at a high volume through headphones</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hearing loss can also occur suddenly&nbsp;after exposure to&nbsp;an exceptionally loud noise, such as an explosion. This is known as acoustic trauma.</p>\n<p>See&nbsp;<a>preventing hearing loss</a>&nbsp;for advice on reducing your risk of noise-induced hearing loss.</p>\n<h2>Other types of sensorineural hearing&nbsp;loss</h2>\n<p>Sensorineural hearing loss occurs if the sensitive hair cells inside the cochlea are damaged, or as a result of damage to the auditory nerve (which transmits sound to the brain). In some cases, both may be damaged.</p>\n<p>Hearing loss caused by age and exposure to loud noises are both types of sensorineural hearing loss.</p>\n<p>Sensorineural hearing loss can&nbsp;also&nbsp;be caused by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the genes you inherit &ndash;&nbsp;some people may be&nbsp;born deaf or become deaf over time&nbsp;because of&nbsp;a genetic abnormality</li>\n<li>viral infections of the inner ear &ndash;&nbsp;such as&nbsp;<a>mumps</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>measles</a></li>\n<li>viral infections of the auditory nerve &ndash;&nbsp;such as mumps or rubella</li>\n<li>M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;where&nbsp;a person suffers with vertigo, spells of hearing loss,&nbsp;<a>tinnitus</a>&nbsp;and the feeling of a blockage in the ear</li>\n<li>acoustic neuroma&nbsp;&ndash; a non-cancerous (benign) growth on or near the auditory nerve</li>\n<li><a>meningitis</a>&nbsp;&ndash; an infection of the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord</li>\n<li>encephalitis&nbsp;&ndash; inflammation&nbsp;of the brain</li>\n<li><a >multiple sclerosis</a>&nbsp;&ndash; a neurological condition affecting the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord)</li>\n<li>a head injury</li>\n<li>an autoimmune condition</li>\n<li>malformation of the ear</li>\n<li><a>stroke</a>&nbsp;&ndash; where the blood supply to the brain is cut off or interrupted</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some&nbsp;treatments and medicines, such as&nbsp;<a>radiotherapy</a>&nbsp;for nasal and sinus cancer, certain&nbsp;<a>chemotherapy</a>&nbsp;medicines or certain&nbsp;<a>antibiotics</a>&nbsp;can also damage the cochlea and the auditory nerve, causing sensorineural hearing loss.</p>\n<p>People with&nbsp;<a>diabetes</a>,&nbsp;<a>chronic kidney disease</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a>cardiovascular disease</a>&nbsp;are also at increased risk of hearing loss.</p>\n<p>Sensorineural hearing loss is permanent and hearing aids are often required to improve hearing in these cases.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Causes of conductive hearing loss</h2>\n<p>Conductive hearing loss is usually caused by a blockage, such as having too much ear wax, a build-up of fluid in the ear&nbsp;(glue ear), or an&nbsp;<a>ear infection</a>.</p>\n<p>Conductive hearing loss can also be caused by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a perforated eardrum&nbsp;&ndash; where the eardrum is torn or has a hole in it</li>\n<li>otosclerosis&nbsp;&ndash; an abnormal growth of bone in the middle ear which causes the inner hearing bone (the stapes) to be less mobile and less effective at transmitting sound</li>\n<li>damage to the hearing bones from injury, a collapsed ear drum or conditions such as&nbsp;cholesteatoma</li>\n<li>swelling around the eustachian tube&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;caused by jaw surgery or radiotherapy for nasal and sinus cancer</li>\n<li>malformation of the ear</li>\n<li>Eustachian tube dysfunction</li>\n<li>something becoming trapped in the ear (a foreign body)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Conductive hearing loss is usually temporary and can often be treated with medication or minor surgery.</p>\n<h2>Diagnosing hearing loss</h2>\n<div class=\"editor\">\n<p>See your GP if you\'re having problems with your hearing. They\'ll examine your ears and carry out some simple hearing tests.</p>\n<h2>Ear examination</h2>\n<p>During an ear examination, an instrument with a light at the end called an auriscope (or otoscope) is used to look for anything abnormal, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a blockage caused by&nbsp;<a>earwax</a>, fluid or an object</li>\n<li>an ear canal infection</li>\n<li>a bulging ear drum&nbsp;&ndash; indicating&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a>infection inside the&nbsp;middle ear</a></li>\n<li>fluid behind the ear drum&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;known as&nbsp;<a>glue ear</a></li>\n<li>a perforated ear drum&nbsp;</li>\n<li>a collapsed ear drum</li>\n<li>skin collected in the middle ear (cholesteatoma)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your GP will ask&nbsp;if you have any pain in your ear and when you first noticed the hearing loss.</p>\n<h2>Referral to a specialist</h2>\n<p>Your GP may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist or an audiologist (a hearing specialist). The specialist will carry out further hearing tests to help determine what\'s causing your hearing loss and recommend the best course of treatment.</p>\n<p>Some of the hearing tests you may have include a:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>tuning fork test (sometimes performed by your GP)</li>\n<li>pure tone audiometry</li>\n<li>bone conduction test</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These tests are described below.</p>\n<h3>Tuning fork test</h3>\n<p>A tuning fork is a Y-shaped, metallic object. It produces sound waves at a fixed pitch when it\'s gently tapped and can be used to test different aspects of your hearing.</p>\n<p>The tester taps the tuning fork on their elbow or knee to make it vibrate, before holding it at different places around your head.</p>\n<p>This test can help determine if you have conductive hearing loss, which is hearing loss caused by sounds not being able to pass freely into the inner ear, or sensorineural hearing loss, where the inner ear or hearing nerve isn\'t working properly.</p>\n<h3>Pure tone audiometry</h3>\n<p>Pure tone audiometry&nbsp;tests the hearing of both ears. During the test, a machine called an audiometer produces sounds at various volumes and frequencies (pitches). You listen to the sounds through headphones and respond when you hear them, usually by pressing a button.</p>\n<h3>Bone conduction test</h3>\n<p>A bone conduction test is often carried out as part of a routine pure tone audiometry test in adults. It\'s used to check if you have sensorineural hearing loss, by testing how well your inner ear is working.</p>\n<p>Bone conduction involves placing a vibrating probe against the mastoid bone behind the ear. It tests how well sounds transmitted through the bone are heard.</p>\n<p>Bone conduction is a more sophisticated version of the tuning fork test, and when used together with pure tone audiometry, it can help to determine whether hearing loss comes from the outer and middle ear (conductive hearing loss), the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss), or both.</p>\n<p>Read about&nbsp;<a>how hearing tests are performed</a></p>\n<h2>Newborn hearing screening</h2>\n<p>All newborn babies are offered a hearing test in the first few weeks after birth as part of the&nbsp;NHS&nbsp;Newborn Hearing Screening Programme.</p>\n<p>The tests helps to identify babies who have permanent hearing loss as soon as possible so that parents can get the support and advice they need.</p>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;<a>the newborn hearing test</a></p>\n<h2>Levels of hearing loss</h2>\n<p>Very few people with hearing loss hear nothing at all. There are four different levels of hearing loss, which are defined by the quietest sound you\'re able to hear, measured in decibels (dB). These are described below.</p>\n<h3>Mild deafness</h3>\n<p>If you\'re mildly deaf, the quietest sound you can hear is 21 to 40dB. Mild deafness can sometimes make&nbsp;hearing speech difficult, particularly in noisy situations.</p>\n<h3>Moderate deafness</h3>\n<p>If you\'re moderately deaf, the quietest sound you can hear is 41 to 70dB. You may have difficulty following speech without using a hearing aid&nbsp;and may find it difficult to hear announcements, for example.</p>\n<h3>Severe deafness</h3>\n<p>If you\'re severely deaf, the quietest sound you\'re able to hear is 71 to 90dB. People who are severely deaf usually need to lip-read or use sign language, even with the use of a hearing aid.</p>\n<h3>Profound deafness</h3>\n<p>If you\'re profoundly deaf, the quietest sound you can hear is more than 90dB. People who are profoundly deaf&nbsp;can benefit from a cochlear implant. Other forms of communication include lip reading and British sign language or signed English.</p>\n<h2>Treating hearing loss</h2>\n<div>\n<p>How hearing loss is treated depends on the underlying cause of the condition.</p>\n<p>Hearing loss that occurs when sounds are unable to pass into the inner ear (conductive hearing loss) is often temporary and treatable.</p>\n<p>For example,&nbsp;<a>earwax build-up</a>&nbsp;can be removed by drops, a syringe or suction. Hearing loss caused by a bacterial infection can be treated with&nbsp;<a>antibiotics</a>. Surgery can be used to drain a fluid build-up, repair&nbsp;a&nbsp;perforated eardrum, or correct problems with the hearing bones.</p>\n<p>However, hearing loss caused by&nbsp;damage to the inner ear or to the&nbsp;nerves that transmit sound to brain (sensorineural hearing loss) is permanent.</p>\n<p>If your hearing is impaired,&nbsp;treatment can improve your hearing and quality of life. Some of these treatments are discussed below.</p>\n<h2>Hearing aids</h2>\n<p>If you have&nbsp;hearing problems, you may be able to wear a hearing aid.&nbsp;About 1.4 million people regularly use hearing aids in the UK, and many more would benefit from them.</p>\n<p>A hearing aid is an electronic device that consists of a microphone, an amplifier, a loudspeaker&nbsp;and a battery. It increases the volume of sound entering your ear, so you&nbsp;can hear things more clearly.</p>\n<p>The microphone picks up sound, which is made louder by the amplifier. Hearing aids are fitted with devices that can distinguish between background noise, such as traffic, and foreground noise, such as conversation.</p>\n<p>Modern hearing aids are very small and discreet, and can often be worn inside your ear.</p>\n<p>Hearing aids help improve hearing, but don\'t give you your hearing back. They\'re suitable for most people, but may be less effective for people with&nbsp;profound hearing impairment or certain conditions. Your GP or audiologist (hearing specialist) can advise you about whether a hearing aid is suitable for you.</p>\n<p>If a hearing aid is recommended, an audiologist&nbsp;may take an impression of your ear so the hearing aid fits you perfectly or may show you an open fit hearing aid. The hearing aid will be adjusted to suit your level of hearing impairment. You\'ll also be shown how to use and care for it.</p>\n<p>After your hearing aid has been fitted, you should&nbsp;have&nbsp;a follow-up appointment&nbsp;within 12 weeks.</p>\n<p>If you experience problems using a hearing aid &ndash; such as distortion and repeated infections &ndash; that can\'t be corrected by an audiologist, you may benefit from different&nbsp;treatments. An ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeon can discuss these with you. An ENT surgeon with a special interest in ear surgery is called an otologist.</p>\n<h3>NHS hearing aids</h3>\n<p>The NHS&nbsp;loans&nbsp;hearing aids to people with hearing loss free of charge. This&nbsp;includes free repairs, batteries and servicing. Many areas now charge for lost hearing aids, but you\'ll be told about any costs at your fitting appointment.</p>\n<p>In the UK, both analogue and digital hearing aids are commonly used. Most hearing aids prescribed through the NHS are now digital.</p>\n<p>Instead of having moving parts, digital hearing aids contain a very small computer that processes sounds. This enables the hearing aid to be programmed to suit different environments, such as a small, quiet room or a large, noisy workshop.</p>\n<p>The type of digital hearing aids available through the NHS are usually the behind-the-ear (BTE) type (see below). Other types of hearing aid&nbsp;may be&nbsp;issued in cases where a medical condition prevents an individual from using BTE hearing aids. You can also choose to pay privately for another type of hearing aid if it\'s not available on the NHS.</p>\n<h2>Types of hearing aids</h2>\n<p>The&nbsp;different types of hearing aids are described below.</p>\n<h3>Behind-the-ear (BTE) hearing aids</h3>\n<p>BTE hearing aids usually have an earmould, which sits inside your ear. The rest of the hearing aid is connected to the earmould and lies behind your ear.</p>\n<p>Some types of BTE hearing aids have two microphones that enable you to listen to sounds in the general vicinity or to focus on sounds that are coming from a specific direction. This can be particularly useful in noisy environments.</p>\n<p>Open fit hearing aids may also be available, which are suitable for those with mild to moderate hearing loss. The tube sits in the ear, instead of an earmould.</p>\n<h3>Receiver in-the-ear (RITE) hearing aids</h3>\n<p>Receiver in-the ear (RITE) hearing aids are similar to BTE hearing aids, but the piece worn behind the ear is connected&nbsp;by a wire to a receiver (loudspeaker) located within the ear canal.</p>\n<p>This means RITE hearing aids are usually less visible than BTE devices.</p>\n<h3>In-the-ear (ITE) hearing aids</h3>\n<p>In-the-ear (ITE) hearing aids are like an earmould. They fill the area just outside your ear canal and fill the opening of your ear canal.</p>\n<p>The working parts of the hearing aid are inside the shell.</p>\n<h3>In-the-canal (ITC) hearing aids</h3>\n<p>In-the-canal (ITC) hearing aids fill the outer part of the ear canal and are just visible.</p>\n<h3>Completely in-the-canal (CIC) hearing aids</h3>\n<p>Completely in-the-canal (CIC) hearing aids are even smaller and less visible than ITE or ITC hearing aids.</p>\n<p>However, they may not be recommended if you have severe hearing loss or frequent ear infections.</p>\n<h3>Body-worn (BW) hearing aids</h3>\n<p>Body-worn (BW) hearing aids have a small box containing the microphone. The box can be clipped to your clothes or you can put it inside a pocket. A lead connects the box to an earphone, which delivers sound to your ear.</p>\n<p>This type of hearing aid is an option for people with poor dexterity, who require a high-powered hearing aid.</p>\n<h3>CROS/BiCROS</h3>\n<p>CROS hearing aids are recommended for people who only have hearing in one ear. They work by picking up sounds from the side that doesn\'t have hearing and transmitting them to the ear that\'s able to hear. The sound is sometimes transmitted through wires, although wireless models are available.</p>\n<p>BiCROS hearing aids work in a similar way to CROS hearing aids, but they amplify the noise entering the ear that\'s able to hear. They\'re useful for people who don\'t have any hearing in one ear, with some&nbsp;hearing loss in the other ear.</p>\n<h3>Bone conduction hearing aids</h3>\n<p>Bone conduction hearing aids are recommended for people with conductive or mixed hearing loss who can\'t wear a more conventional type of hearing aid. Bone conduction hearing aids vibrate in response to the sounds going into the microphone.</p>\n<p>They can also sometimes help people with no hearing in one ear and normal or mild hearing loss in the other ear.</p>\n<p>The part of the hearing aid that vibrates is held against the bone behind the ear (mastoid) by a headband. The vibrations pass through the mastoid bone to the cochlea and are converted into sound in the usual way. They can be very effective, but can be uncomfortable to wear for long periods.</p>\n<h3>Bone Anchored Hearing Aids (BAHA)</h3>\n<p>A Bone Anchored Hearing Aid (BAHA) transmits sound directly to the cochlea by vibrating the mastoid bone. A minor operation is needed to fix a screw to the skull, on which the hearing aid can be clipped on and off. A BAHA is removed at night and when you swim or take a shower.</p>\n<p>Unlike a bone conduction hearing aid, it\'s not uncomfortable to wear and is used for patients with conductive hearing loss, or in some patients who have no hearing in one of their ears.</p>\n<p>Some people may benefit from newer types of implantable bone conduction hearing aids that are held onto the head with magnets instead of a connector through the skin. However, these are only available at some BAHA centres and may require a referral to a different BAHA centre.</p>\n<h3>Middle ear implants</h3>\n<p>These are surgically implanted devices that attach to the hearing bones and make them vibrate.</p>\n<p>They\'re suitable for people who can\'t use a hearing aid, but have hearing loss at a level where a BAHA would not help.</p>\n<h3>Disposable hearing aids</h3>\n<p>Disposable hearing aids are sometimes recommended for people who have mild to moderate hearing loss.</p>\n<p>The battery inside a disposable hearing aid usually lasts for about 12 weeks, after which time the hearing aid is thrown away and replaced. Disposable hearing aids&nbsp;tend to be&nbsp;expensive in the long term&nbsp;and are only available privately.</p>\n<h2>Cochlear implants</h2>\n<p>Cochlear implants are small hearing devices fitted under the skin behind&nbsp;your ear during surgery.</p>\n<p>They have an external sound processor and internal parts, including a receiver coil, an electronics package and a long wire with electrodes on it (an electrode array).</p>\n<p>The external processor takes in sound, analyses it and then converts it to signals that are transmitted across the skin to an internal receiver-stimulator, which sends the signals along the electrode array into a part of the inner ear called the cochlea. The signal is then sent to the brain along the hearing nerve as normal. This means cochlear implants are only suitable for people whose hearing nerves are functioning normally.</p>\n<p>A cochlear implant is sometimes recommended&nbsp;for adults or children who have severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss&nbsp;in both&nbsp;ears, which isn\'t helped by hearing aids.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Both ears are usually implanted for children, whereas adults are usually only&nbsp;able to have&nbsp;one implant on the NHS.</p>\n<p>Before a cochlear implant is recommended, you\'ll be assessed to find out whether it will help improve your hearing. During the assessment, any disabilities or communication problems you have will be taken into consideration, which may mean the usual hearing tests aren\'t suitable.</p>\n<p>If a cochlear implant is recommended, it will be inserted into your ear (or both ears)&nbsp;during an operation and switched on a&nbsp;few weeks later.</p>\n<p>There are currently around 11,000 people in the UK with cochlear implants and the number is increasing each year.</p>\n<h3>Safety</h3>\n<p>According to the Medicines &amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), evidence suggests that patients with cochlear implants may be at an increased risk from pneumococcal meningitis, especially if they haven\'t been immunised against pneumococcal disease.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In August 2002, the Department of Health included cochlear implant patients in the population groups who should be immunised against pneumococcal infection.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Although the risk of contracting bacterial meningitis is low, it\'s slightly higher than for the general population.</p>\n<h2>Auditory brainstem implants</h2>\n<p>In some cases of severe to profound&nbsp;hearing loss, where there are problems with&nbsp;the&nbsp;nerve that transmits sound to the brain, an auditory brainstem implant (ABI) may be used.</p>\n<p>An ABI is an electrical device made&nbsp;up of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>electrodes implanted into the part of the brain responsible for processing sound (in the brainstem)</li>\n<li>a receiver device placed&nbsp;under the skin&nbsp;behind your ear</li>\n<li>a small sound processor&nbsp;outside your ear</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When&nbsp;the microphone in the sound processor picks up sound, it turns it into an electrical signal and&nbsp;transmits this to the brain through the receiver and electrodes.</p>\n<p>An ABI will not fully restore your hearing, but it can usually restore some degree of hearing and can make lip-reading easier. It\'s&nbsp;often used as a treatment for hearing loss associated with a condition called neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2).</p>\n<h2>Lip reading and&nbsp;sign language</h2>\n<p>Hearing&nbsp;loss can sometimes affect your speech, as well as your ability to understand other people. Many people with significant hearing&nbsp;loss learn to communicate in other ways instead of, or as well as, spoken English.</p>\n<p>For people who experience hearing loss after they\'ve learnt to talk, lip-reading can be a very useful skill. Lip-reading is where you watch a person&rsquo;s mouth movements while they\'re speaking, to understand what they\'re saying.</p>\n<p>For people born with a hearing impairment, lip-reading is much more difficult. Those who are born with a hearing impairment often learn&nbsp;<a>sign language</a>, such as British Sign Language (BSL), which is a form of communication that uses hand movements and facial expressions to convey meaning.</p>\n<p>BSL is completely different from spoken English and has its own grammar and syntax (word order). Other types of sign language include Signed English and Paget Gorman Signed Speech.</p>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>','Hearing loss','2023-07-09 11:05:43','2023-07-09 11:05:43',NULL),(43,42,NULL,'Labyrinthitis','<h1>Labyrinthitis:</h1>\n<h2>About labyrinthitis</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Labyrinthitis is an inner ear infection. It causes a delicate structure deep inside your ear called the labyrinth to become inflamed, affecting your hearing and balance.</p>\n<p>The most common symptoms are&nbsp;<a>dizziness</a>,&nbsp;<a>hearing loss</a>&nbsp;(from mild to total loss of hearing) and&nbsp;<a>vertigo</a>&nbsp;&ndash; the sensation that you, or the environment around you, is moving.</p>\n<p>These symptoms can range from mild to severe, with some people feeling that they are unable to remain upright. Other symptoms include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a feeling of pressure inside your ear(s)</li>\n<li>ringing or humming in your ear(s) (<a>tinnitus</a>)</li>\n<li>fluid or pus leaking out of your ear(s)</li>\n<li>ear pain</li>\n<li>feeling sick (nausea) or being sick</li>\n<li>a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above</li>\n<li>changes in vision, such as blurred vision or double vision</li>\n<li>mild headaches&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Certain things can make the dizziness worse, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>colds or illness&nbsp;</li>\n<li>the dark</li>\n<li>being in crowded areas or small rooms</li>\n<li>tiredness</li>\n<li>a women&rsquo;s period</li>\n<li>walking</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See your GP if you have these symptoms.<br /><br />You should also avoid driving, using tools and machinery, or working at heights if you\'re feeling dizzy.</p>\n<h2>Treating labyrinthitis</h2>\n<p>In most cases, the symptoms pass within a few weeks.&nbsp;<a>Treatment</a>&nbsp;involves a combination of bed rest and medication to help you cope better with the symptoms. You may need additional medication to fight the underlying infection, although antibiotics are not often required as the cause is most commonly due to a virus.</p>\n<p>Contact your GP if you do not notice any improvement after three weeks. You may need to be referred to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist.</p>\n<p>A small number of people have persistent symptoms that last for several months, or possibly years. This requires a more intensive type of treatment called vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT).</p>\n<h2>The labyrinth</h2>\n<p>The labyrinth is the innermost part of the ear. It contains two important parts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the cochlea &ndash; this relays sounds to the brain and is responsible for hearing</li>\n<li>the vestibular system &ndash; a complex set of fluid-filled channels that contributes to your sense of balance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Inflammation of the labyrinth can disrupt your hearing and sense of balance, triggering the symptoms of labyrinthitis. The labyrinth usually becomes inflamed either because of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a viral infection, such as a&nbsp;<a>cold</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>flu</a></li>\n<li>a bacterial infection, which is much less common</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Who gets labyrinthitis?</h2>\n<p>Most cases of viral labyrinthitis occur in adults aged 30 to 60 years old. Viral labyrinthitis is relatively common in adults. Other types of ear infections are usually more widespread in children. Bacterial labyrinthitis is much less common. Younger children under two years old are more vulnerable to developing bacterial labyrinthitis.</p>\n<h2>Complications of labyrinthitis</h2>\n<p>Bacterial labyrinthitis carries a higher risk of causing permanent hearing loss, particularly in children who have developed it as a complication of meningitis.</p>\n<p>Because of this high risk, a hearing test is recommended following bacterial labyrinthitis.</p>\n<p>Severe hearing loss following bacterial labyrinthitis can sometimes be treated with a cochlear implant. This is not a conventional hearing aid, but a small electronic device fitted under the skin behind the ear during surgery.</p>\n<p>Read more information about&nbsp;<a>hearing loss</a></p>\n<h2>Vestibular neuronitis</h2>\n<p>Many people diagnosed with labyrinthitis only experience the balance symptoms without hearing loss.</p>\n<p>This is actually known as&nbsp;vestibular neuronitis rather than labyrinthitis.</p>\n<p>However, both terms are often used to describe the same diagnosis.</p>\n<h2>Causes of labyrinthitis</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Labyrinthitis is caused by inflammation of part of the inner ear known as the labyrinth. This is caused by an infection.</p>\n<h2>How the labyrinth works</h2>\n<p>The fluid-filled channels of the labyrinth are known as the vestibular system and they are connected at different angles. This fluid moves when you move your head, telling your brain how far, fast and in what direction your head is moving. This allows your body to balance properly. The vestibular system works in a similar way to a stereo, with your left and right ears sending separate signals to your brain. If one ear becomes infected, these signals become out of sync, which confuses your brain and triggers symptoms such as dizziness and loss of balance.</p>\n<p>The labyrinth also contains a small, spiral-shaped cavity called the cochlea. It sends sound waves to the language processing areas of the brain. Inflammation can disrupt this function, leading to hearing loss.</p>\n<h2>Viral labyrinthitis</h2>\n<p>Around half of all cases of viral labyrinthitis are thought to be caused when a viral infection of the chest, nose, mouth and airways &ndash;&nbsp;such as the&nbsp;<a>common cold</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>flu</a>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;spreads to the inner ear.</p>\n<p>Infections that affect the rest of the&nbsp;body, such as&nbsp;<a>measles</a>,&nbsp;<a>mumps</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>glandular fever</a>, are a less common cause of viral labyrinthitis.</p>\n<h2>Bacterial labyrinthitis</h2>\n<p>Labyrinthitis can sometimes be caused by a bacterial infection. This is rarer than a viral infection and is likely to be more serious.</p>\n<p>Bacteria can enter the labyrinth if the thin layers of tissue that separate your middle ear from your inner ear are broken. This can happen if you have a&nbsp;<a>middle ear infection</a>&nbsp;or an infection of the brain lining (<a>meningitis</a>). Bacteria can also get into your inner ear if you have had a head injury.</p>\n<h2>Immune system problems</h2>\n<p>Labyrinthitis often develops in people who have an underlying autoimmune condition (where the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue rather than fighting off infections).</p>\n<h2>Diagnosing labyrinthitis</h2>\n<div class=\"editor\">\n<p>Many conditions can cause dizziness and vertigo. Your GP will usually diagnose labyrinthitis based on your symptoms, your medical history and a physical examination.</p>\n<p>Your GP may carry out the following tests:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a physical examination &ndash; you may be asked to move your head or body and your ears will be checked for signs of inflammation and infection</li>\n<li>hearing tests&nbsp;&ndash; labyrinthitis is more likely if&nbsp;you have&nbsp;<a>hearing loss</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your GP will also check your eyes. If they are flickering uncontrollably, it is usually a sign that your vestibular system (the body\'s balancing system) is not working properly.</p>\n<h2>Viral or bacterial labyrinthitis?</h2>\n<p>There is no reliable test to determine whether labyrinthitis is caused by a viral or bacterial infection&nbsp;because testing for infection would damage the labyrinth.</p>\n<p>Doctors can usually safely assume that labyrinthitis is the result of a viral infection (more common) unless there is strong evidence to suggest otherwise, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the labyrinthitis is in a very young child</li>\n<li>labyrinthitis occurs in someone who is already known to have a bacterial infection</li>\n<li>you have common bacterial labyrinthitis symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and complete hearing loss</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Further testing</h2>\n<p>Further testing is usually only required if you have additional symptoms that suggest&nbsp;you may&nbsp;have a more serious condition, such as meningitis or a stroke.&nbsp;Symptoms can&nbsp;include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>severe headache</li>\n<li>mental confusion</li>\n<li>slurred speech</li>\n<li>weakness or paralysis on one side of your body</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These&nbsp;tests can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a&nbsp;lumbar puncture&nbsp;&ndash; a fluid sample is taken from the base of your spine and checked for infection</li>\n<li><a>computerised tomography (CT) scan</a>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;to give a three-dimensional picture of your brain</li>\n<li><a>magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan</a>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;to give a detailed image of your brain</li>\n<li><a>blood tests</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Treating labyrinthitis</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Labyrinthitis is usually treated using a combination of self-help techniques and medication. Chronic labyrinthitis may be treated with vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT).</p>\n<h2>Self-help</h2>\n<p>Drink plenty of liquid, little and often, particularly water, to avoid becoming&nbsp;<a>dehydrated</a>.</p>\n<p>In its early stages, you may feel constantly dizzy and it can give you severe vertigo. You should rest in bed to avoid falling and injuring yourself. After a few days, the worst of these symptoms should have passed and you should no longer feel dizzy all the time.</p>\n<p>You can do several things&nbsp;to minimise any remaining feelings of&nbsp;dizziness and&nbsp;<a>vertigo</a>. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>during an attack, lie still in a comfortable position (on your side is often best)</li>\n<li>avoid alcohol</li>\n<li>avoid bright lights</li>\n<li>try to cut out noise and anything that causes stress from your surroundings</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should also avoid driving, using tools and machinery or working at heights if you\'re feeling dizzy and unbalanced.</p>\n<h2>Medication</h2>\n<p>If your dizziness, vertigo and loss of balance are particularly severe, your GP may prescribe a short course of medication such as benzodiazepine or antiemetics (vestibular sedatives).</p>\n<h3>Benzodiazepine</h3>\n<p>Benzodiazepines reduce activity inside your central nervous system. This means your brain is less likely to be affected by the abnormal signals coming from your vestibular system.</p>\n<p>However, long-term use of benzodiazepines is not recommended because they can be highly addictive if used for long periods.</p>\n<h3>Antiemetics</h3>\n<p>A prescription medication known as an antiemetic may be prescribed if you\'re experiencing nausea and vomiting.</p>\n<p>Prochlorperazine 5mg tablets are an antiemetic used to treat the symptoms of vertigo and dizziness. It may be considered as an alternative treatment to benzodiazepines.</p>\n<p>Most people are able to tolerate prochlorperazine and side effects are uncommon, but can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>tremors (shaking)</li>\n<li>abnormal or involuntary body and facial movements</li>\n<li>sleepiness</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are vomiting, there is a prochlorperazine 3mg tablet available which you place inside your mouth between your gums and cheek.</p>\n<h3>Corticosteroids</h3>\n<p><a>Corticosteroids</a>&nbsp;such as prednisolone may be recommended if your symptoms are particularly severe. They are often effective at reducing inflammation.</p>\n<h3>Antibiotics</h3>\n<p>If your labyrinthitis is thought to be caused by a bacterial infection, you will be prescribed&nbsp;<a>antibiotics</a>. Depending on how serious the infection is, this could either be antibiotic tablets or capsules (oral antibiotics) or antibiotic injections (intravenous antibiotics).</p>\n<p>Check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicines for a full list of possible side effects.</p>\n<h3>When to seek further advice</h3>\n<p>Contact your GP if you develop additional symptoms that suggest your condition may be getting worse. If this happens, you may be admitted to hospital. These symptoms include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>mental confusion</li>\n<li>slurred speech</li>\n<li>double vision&nbsp;</li>\n<li>weakness or numbness in one part of your body</li>\n<li>a change in the way you usually walk</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also contact your GP if you do not notice any improvement after three weeks. You may need to be referred to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist.</p>\n<h2>Chronic labyrinthitis</h2>\n<p>A small number of people experience dizziness and vertigo for months or even years. This is sometimes known as chronic labyrinthitis.</p>\n<p>The symptoms are not usually as severe as when you first get the condition, although even mild&nbsp;dizziness can have a considerable impact on your quality of life, employment and other daily activities.</p>\n<h3>Vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT)</h3>\n<p>Vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) is an effective treatment for people with chronic labyrinthitis. VRT attempts to \"retrain\" your brain and nervous system to compensate for the abnormal signals coming from your vestibular system.</p>\n<p>VRT is usually carried out under the supervision of a physiotherapist and involves a range of exercises designed to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>co-ordinate your hand and eye movements</li>\n<li>stimulate sensations of dizziness so your brain starts to get used to disruptive signals sent by your vestibular system and then ignores them</li>\n<li>improve your balance and walking ability</li>\n<li>improve your strength and fitness</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Brain and Spine Foundation is a UK charity that has more information about&nbsp;<a>vestibular rehabilitation</a>&nbsp;on its website.</p>\n<p>You can ask your GP to refer you to a physiotherapist or you can pay for private treatment. If you decide to see a private physiotherapist, make sure they are fully qualified and a member of a recognised body, such as the&nbsp;<a>Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP)</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>','Labyrinthitis','2023-07-09 11:05:43','2023-07-09 11:05:43',NULL),(44,43,NULL,'Middle ear infection','<h1>Middle ear infection (otitis media):</h1>\n<h2>About middle ear infections</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Otitis media is an infection of the middle ear that causes inflammation (redness and swelling) and a build-up of fluid behind the eardrum.</p>\n<p>Anyone can develop a middle ear infection but infants between&nbsp;six and 15 months old are most commonly affected.</p>\n<p>It\'s estimated that around one&nbsp;in every four children experience at least one middle ear infection by the time they\'re 10 years old.</p>\n<h2>Symptoms of&nbsp;a middle ear infection</h2>\n<p>In most cases, the symptoms of a middle&nbsp;ear infection (otitis media) develop&nbsp;quickly and resolve in a few days.

The adenoid can be removed if it causes persistent or frequent ear infections. Read more about&nbsp;removing adenoids.</p>\n<p>Younger children are particularly vulnerable to middle ear infections as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the Eustachian tube is smaller in children than in adults</li>\n<li>a child\'s adenoids are relatively&nbsp;much larger than an adults</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Certain conditions can also increase the risk of middle ear infections, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>having a cleft palate&nbsp;&ndash; a type of birth defect where a child has a split in the roof of their mouth</li>\n<li>having&nbsp;<a>Down\'s syndrome</a>&nbsp;&ndash; a genetic condition that typically causes some level of learning disability and a characteristic range of physical features</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Can middle ear infections be prevented?</h2>\n<p>It\'s not possible to prevent middle ear infections, but there are some things you can do that may reduce your child\'s risk of developing the condition. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>make sure your child is up-to-date with their routine vaccinations&nbsp;&ndash; particularly the pneumococcal vaccine&nbsp;and the DTaP/IPV/Hib (5-in-1)&nbsp;vaccine</li>\n<li>avoid exposing your child to smoky environments (passive smoking)</li>\n<li>don\'t give your child a dummy once they\'re&nbsp;older than&nbsp;six to 12 months old</li>\n<li>don\'t feed your child while they\'re lying flat on their back</li>\n<li>if possible, feed your baby with breast milk rather than formula milk</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Avoiding contact with other children who are unwell may also help reduce your child\'s chances of catching an infection that could lead to a middle ear infection.</p>\n<h2>Further problems</h2>\n<p>Complications of middle ear infections are fairly rare, but can be serious if they do occur.</p>\n<p>Most complications are the result of the infection spreading to another part of the ear or head, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the bones behind the ear (mastoiditis)</li>\n<li>the inner ear (<a>labyrinthitis</a>)</li>\n<li>the protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord&nbsp;(<a >meningitis</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If complications do develop, they often need to be treated immediately with antibiotics in hospital.</p>\n<h2>Diagnosing middle ear infections</h2>\n<div>\n<p>A middle ear infection (otitis media) can usually be diagnosed using an instrument called an otoscope.</p>\n<p>An otoscope is a small handheld device with a magnifying glass and a light source at the end. Using an otoscope, a&nbsp;doctor&nbsp;can&nbsp;examine the ear to look for signs of fluid in the middle ear, which may indicate an infection.</p>\n<p>Signs of fluid in the middle ear can include the ear drum:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>bulging</li>\n<li>being an unusual colour (usually red or yellow)</li>\n<li>having a cloudy appearance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In some cases, a hole may have developed in the eardrum (perforated ear drum) and there may be fluid in the ear canal (the tube between the outer ear and eardrum).</p>\n<p>Some otoscopes can also be used to blow a small puff of air into the ear to check for any blockages in the middle ear, which&nbsp;could be a sign of an infection.&nbsp;If the Eustachian tube (the tube that connects&nbsp;the throat and middle ear) is clear, the eardrum will move slightly.&nbsp;If it\'s blocked, the eardrum will remain still.</p>\n<h2>Further&nbsp;tests</h2>\n<p>Further tests are normally only required if treatment&nbsp;isn\'t working or complications develop.&nbsp;These tests will usually be carried out at your local ear, nose and throat (ENT) department.</p>\n<p>Some of the&nbsp;tests that may be carried out are described below.</p>\n<h3>Tympanometry</h3>\n<p>Tympanometry is a test that measures how the ear drum reacts to changes in air pressure.</p>\n<p>During a tympanometry test, a probe is placed into your child\'s ear. The probe changes the air pressure at regular intervals while transmitting a sound into the ear. A measuring device is attached to the probe to record how the drum moves and how changes in air pressure affect this movement.</p>\n<p>A healthy ear drum should move easily if there\'s a change in air pressure. If your child\'s ear drum moves slowly or not at all, it usually suggests there\'s fluid behind it.</p>\n<h3>Audiometry</h3>\n<p>Audiometry is a hearing test that uses a machine called an audiometer to produce sounds of different volume and frequency. This can help determine if your child has any hearing loss as a result of their condition.</p>\n<p>During the test, your child listens through headphones and is asked if&nbsp;they can hear&nbsp;the sounds.</p>\n<h3>Scans</h3>\n<p>On the very rare occasions where there\'s a possibility the infection has spread out of the middle ear and into the surrounding area, a scan of the ear may be carried out. This may be&nbsp;either a:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a >computerised&nbsp;tomography (CT) scan</a></li>\n<li><a>magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>A CT scan takes a series of&nbsp;<a>X-rays</a>&nbsp;and uses a computer to assemble the scans into a more detailed image, whereas an MRI scan uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce images of the inside of the body.</p>\n<h2>Treating middle ear infections</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Most middle ear infections (otitis media) clear up within three to five days and don\'t need any specific treatment.</p>\n<p>You can relieve any pain and a high temperature using over the counter painkillers such as&nbsp;<a>paracetamol</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a>ibuprofen</a>.</p>\n<p>Make sure any painkillers you give to your child are appropriate for their age.</p>\n<p>Placing a warm flannel or washcloth over the affected ear may also help relieve pain until the condition passes.</p>\n<h2>Antibiotics</h2>\n<p><a>Antibiotics</a>&nbsp;aren\'t routinely used to treat middle ear infections as there\'s no evidence that they speed up the healing process. Many cases are&nbsp;caused by viruses, which antibiotics aren\'t effective against.</p>\n<p>Using antibiotics to treat minor bacterial infections also increases the likelihood of bacteria&nbsp;becoming&nbsp;resistant to them over time. This&nbsp;means more serious infections could become untreatable in the future. Read about antibiotic resistance&nbsp;for more information.</p>\n<p>If antibiotics are needed,&nbsp;a five-day course of an antibiotic called amoxicillin is&nbsp;usually prescribed. This is often given as a liquid. Common side effects of amoxicillin include:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a rash</li>\n<li>feeling sick</li>\n<li><a>diarrhoea</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>An alternative antibiotic such as erythromycin&nbsp;or clarithromycin may be used for people allergic to amoxicillin.</p>\n<p>In some cases, your GP&nbsp;may give you&nbsp;a prescription that you can choose to pick up a few days later if the condition hasn\'t improved by then.</p>\n<p>Adults and children who develop a long-term middle ear infection (chronic suppurative otitis media) may benefit from short courses of antibiotic ear drops.</p>\n<h3>Children</h3>\n<p>Antibiotics&nbsp;are usually only considered&nbsp;if your child:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>has a serious health condition that makes them more vulnerable to&nbsp;complications, such as&nbsp;<a >cystic fibrosis</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>congenital heart disease</a></li>\n<li>is less than three months old</li>\n<li>is less than&nbsp;two years old with an infection in both ears</li>\n<li>has&nbsp;discharge coming from their ear</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Adults&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Adults may be prescribed antibiotics if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>they have&nbsp;a serious health condition that makes them more vulnerable to&nbsp;complications, such as&nbsp;cystic fibrosis or&nbsp;<a>congenital heart disease</a></li>\n<li>symptoms are showing no signs of improvement after four days</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Grommets</h2>\n<p>For children with recurrent severe middle ear infections, tiny tubes may be inserted&nbsp;into the eardrum to help drain fluid. These tubes are called grommets.</p>\n<p>Grommets are inserted under&nbsp;<a>general anaesthetic</a>, which means your child&nbsp;will be&nbsp;asleep and won\'t feel any pain. The procedure&nbsp;usually only takes about 15 minutes and your child should be able to go home the same day.</p>\n<p>A grommet helps keep the eardrum open for several months. As the eardrum starts to heal, the grommet will slowly be pushed out of the eardrum and eventually falls out. This process happens naturally and shouldn\'t be painful. Most grommets fall out within&nbsp;six to 12 months of being inserted.</p>\n<p>Some children need another procedure to replace the grommets if they\'re still experiencing problems.</p>\n<p>Treatment with grommets isn\'t routinely funded in all areas or for adults with recurrent otitis media.</p>\n<h2>Complications of middle ear infections</h2>\n<div class=\"editor\">\n<p>Serious complications of middle ear infections (otitis media) are rare but very young children are still at risk because their immune systems are still developing.</p>\n<p>Some of the main complications associated with middle ear infections are detailed below.</p>\n<h2>Mastoiditis</h2>\n<p>Mastoiditis&nbsp;can develop if an infection spreads out of the middle ear and into the area of bone underneath the ear (the mastoids).</p>\n<p>Symptoms of mastoiditis can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a high temperature (fever)</li>\n<li>swelling behind the ear, which pushes it forward&nbsp;</li>\n<li>redness and tenderness or pain behind the ear</li>\n<li>a creamy discharge from the ear&nbsp;</li>\n<li><a>headache</a></li>\n<li><a>hearing loss</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mastoiditis is usually treated&nbsp;in hospital with&nbsp;<a >antibiotics</a>&nbsp;given through a drip directly into a vein (intravenously). In some cases, surgery may be required&nbsp;to drain the ear and remove the infected mastoid bone.</p>\n<h2>Cholesteatoma</h2>\n<p>A cholesteatoma&nbsp;is&nbsp;an abnormal collection of skin cells inside the ear that can sometimes develop as a result of recurring or persistent middle ear infections.</p>\n<p>If it\'s not treated, a cholesteatoma can eventually damage the delicate structures deep inside your ear, such as the tiny bones that are essential for hearing.</p>\n<p>Symptoms of a cholesteatoma can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>hearing loss</li>\n<li>weakness in half your face</li>\n<li>dizziness</li>\n<li><a>tinnitus</a>&nbsp;&ndash; hearing sounds&nbsp;from inside their body rather than from an outside source</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In most cases, surgery is required to remove a cholesteatoma.</p>\n<h2>Labyrinthitis</h2>\n<p>In some cases, an infection in the middle ear can spread into the inner ear and affect the delicate structure deep inside the ear called the labyrinth. This is known as&nbsp;<a>labyrinthitis</a>.</p>\n<p>Symptoms of labyrinthitis can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>dizziness</li>\n<li><a>vertigo</a>&nbsp;(the feeling that you, or the environment around you, is moving or spinning)</li>\n<li>loss of balance</li>\n<li>hearing loss</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The symptoms of labyrinthitis usually pass within a few weeks, although medication to relieve the symptoms and treat the underlying infection may sometimes be prescribed.&nbsp;<a>treating labyrinthitis</a>.</p>\n<h2>Problems with speech and language development</h2>\n<p>If your child has frequent ear infections that affect their hearing&nbsp;while they\'re very young, there\'s a risk their speech and language development may be affected.</p>\n<p>Contact your GP for advice if you\'re concerned about your child\'s development at any point.</p>\n<h2>Facial paralysis</h2>\n<p>In very rare cases, the swelling associated with otitis media can cause the facial nerve to become compressed. The facial nerve is a section of nerve that runs through the skull and is used by the brain to control facial expressions.</p>\n<p>Compression of the nerve can lead to a person being unable to move some or all of their face. This is known as facial paralysis.</p>\n<p>This can be&nbsp;frightening when it first occurs, as many parents are concerned their child may have experienced a&nbsp;<a>stroke</a>.&nbsp;However, the condition usually resolves once the underlying infection has passed and rarely causes any long-term problems.</p>\n<h2>Meningitis</h2>\n<p>A very&nbsp;rare and serious complication of a middle ear infection&nbsp;is&nbsp;<a>meningitis</a>. This can occur if the infection spreads to the protective outer layer of the brain and spinal cord (the meninges).</p>\n<p>Symptoms of meningitis can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>severe headache</li>\n<li>being sick</li>\n<li>a high temperature (fever)</li>\n<li>stiff neck</li>\n<li>sensitivity to light</li>\n<li>rapid breathing</li>\n<li>a blotchy red rash that does not fade or change colour when you place a glass against it (although this is not always present)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you think your child may have meningitis, call 999 and ask for an ambulance.</p>\n<p>Meningitis caused by a bacterial infection is usually treated in hospital with antibiotics given through a drip directly into a vein (intravenously).&nbsp;<a>treating meningitis</a>.</p>\n<h2>Brain abscess</h2>\n<p>Another very rare and serious complication of&nbsp;a middle ear infection&nbsp;is a brain abscess. This is a pus-filled swelling that develops inside the brain.</p>\n<p>Symptoms of a brain abscess can&nbsp;include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a severe headache</li>\n<li>changes in mental state, such as confusion</li>\n<li>weakness or&nbsp;paralysis on one side of the body</li>\n<li>a high temperature (fever)</li>\n<li>seizures (fits)&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you suspect that you or someone you know may have a brain abscess, call 999 for an ambulance.</p>\n<p>A brain abscess is usually treated using a combination of antibiotics and surgery. The surgeon will usually open the skull and drain the pus from the abscess or remove the abscess entirely.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>','Middle ear infection','2023-07-09 11:05:43','2023-07-09 11:05:43',NULL),(45,44,NULL,'Meniere\'s disease','<h1>Meniere\'s disease:</h1>\n<h2>About Meniere\'s disease</h2>\n<div>\n<p>M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease is a rare disorder that affects the inner ear. It can cause&nbsp;<a>vertigo</a>,&nbsp;<a >tinnitus</a>,&nbsp;<a>hearing loss</a>, and a feeling of pressure deep inside the ear.</p>\n<p>People with M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease usually experience some or all of these symptoms during sudden attacks, which typically last around two to three hours, although it can take a day or two for the symptoms to disappear completely.</p>\n<p>It\'s worth noting, however, that the symptoms and severity of M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease vary widely from person to person. Some people may experience frequent attacks of vertigo along with hearing loss, while others may have severe tinnitus with minor vertigo. Other symptoms include sensitivity to sound (hyperacusis) or distorted sound.</p>\n<p>See your GP if you experience any of the symptoms of M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease, so they can try to identify the problem and refer you to a specialist if necessary.</p>\n<h2>How&nbsp;M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease progresses</h2>\n<p>M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease often progresses through different stages. In the early stages, most people have sudden and unpredictable attacks of vertigo, accompanied by nausea, vomiting and dizziness.</p>\n<p>The attacks of vertigo continue, but may come and go&nbsp;and become less severe. It\'s common to experience a loss of balance or dizziness before or after these attacks. Permanent hearing loss and tinnitus continue to develop and may be worse during attacks of vertigo.</p>\n<p>During the later stages, the episodes of vertigo tend to occur less frequently and&nbsp;sometimes stop altogether over time. However, the tinnitus and hearing loss often become worse and&nbsp;you may be left with permanent balance and hearing&nbsp;problems.</p>\n<h2>Who is affected</h2>\n<p>In the UK, it\'s estimated that around one in 1,000 people have M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease.</p>\n<p>M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease most commonly affects people aged 20-60 and it\'s thought to be slightly more common in women than men.</p>\n<h2>What causes M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease?</h2>\n<p>The exact cause of M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease is unknown, but it\'s thought to be caused by a problem with pressure deep inside the ear.</p>\n<p>Factors&nbsp;that can increase your risk of developing M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease include a family history of the condition and a chemical imbalance in the fluid in your inner ear.</p>\n<h2>How&nbsp;M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease is treated</h2>\n<p>Treatments for&nbsp;M&eacute;ni&egrave;re&rsquo;s disease can usually help people with the condition control their symptoms. However, current treatments aren\'t able to cure the condition.</p>\n<p>Possible treatments include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>medicines to treat the symptoms and prevent attacks</li>\n<li>changes to your eating habits, such as a low-salt diet</li>\n<li>balance training (vestibular rehabilitation)</li>\n<li>relaxation techniques</li>\n<li>surgery, in more severe cases</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A&nbsp;number of different surgical procedures&nbsp;may be used to treat M&eacute;ni&egrave;res disease, depending on how severe the symptoms are and whether one or both ears are affected. However, the effectiveness of surgery is&nbsp;unclear and research is continuing.</p>\n<h2>Support and advice</h2>\n<p>Some people with M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease also find that the condition affects their&nbsp;mental health. The unpredictable nature of the attacks and the restrictions this can place on your activities can lead to feelings of anxiety and&nbsp;<a>depression</a>.</p>\n<p>Your GP can offer advice and support if you\'re finding it difficult to cope with the effect M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease is having on your life. There are also a number of support groups, that could provide assistance and advice.</p>\n<h2>nformation about you</h2>\n<p>If you have&nbsp;M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease, your clinical team may pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).</p>\n<p>This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.</p>\n<h2>Symptoms of Meniere\'s disease</h2>\n<div class=\"editor\">\n<p>The symptoms of M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease vary from person to person. They often begin as sudden attacks, lasting for a few hours. Some people may experience several attacks each week or they may be separated by weeks, months or even years.</p>\n<p>See your GP if you experience any of the symptoms of M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease, so they can try to identify the problem and refer you to a specialist, if necessary.</p>\n<h2>Main symptoms</h2>\n<p>The main symptoms of&nbsp;M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>vertigo &ndash; the sensation that you, or the environment around you, is moving or spinning</li>\n<li>tinnitus &ndash;&nbsp;hearing sounds from inside&nbsp;your body, rather than from an outside source</li>\n<li><a>hearing loss</a>, with a particular difficulty hearing deep or low sounds</li>\n<li>a sense of pressure or fullness&nbsp;deep inside the&nbsp;ear</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These symptoms&nbsp;usually only affect one ear at first, but both ears&nbsp;often become affected over time.</p>\n<p>Vertigo and tinnitus are described in more detail below.</p>\n<h3>Vertigo</h3>\n<p><a>Vertigo</a>&nbsp;is one of the most common and noticeable symptoms of M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As well as a sensation of spinning, you may also experience additional symptoms during an attack of vertigo, such as dizziness, feeling or being sick, and problems with balance. You may have difficulty standing or walking. Occasionally, you may have \"drop attacks\", where you suddenly fall to the ground.</p>\n<p>During a severe attack,&nbsp;you may&nbsp;also experience sweating,&nbsp;<a>diarrhoea</a>&nbsp;and rapid or irregular heartbeats.</p>\n<h3>Tinnitus</h3>\n<p><a>Tinnitus</a>&nbsp;is usually more noticeable when you\'re tired or when it\'s quiet, as there\'s less background noise to distract you from sounds coming from inside your body.</p>\n<p>Examples of&nbsp;sounds you may hear include buzzing, humming, grinding, hissing and whistling.</p>\n<h2>Stages of M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease</h2>\n<p>M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease is often&nbsp;divided into early, middle and late stages.</p>\n<p>However, the progression of M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease varies between individuals. You may not necessarily pass through each of these stages and the severity of the symptoms may also vary. In general, people experience more attacks during the first few years, and then as the attacks decrease in frequency over time, the hearing loss becomes progressively worse.</p>\n<p>Some or all of the following&nbsp;symptoms may be experienced before an attack:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>loss of balance&nbsp;</li>\n<li>dizziness and lightheadedness</li>\n<li>headache and increased ear pressure</li>\n<li>increased hearing loss or tinnitus</li>\n<li>sensitivity to sound</li>\n<li>a feeling of uneasiness</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If a person is aware of these warning symptoms, it can allow&nbsp;them to move to a safer or more comfortable situation before an attack.</p>\n<p>The stages of M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease are described in more detail below.</p>\n<h3>Early stage</h3>\n<p>The early stage of M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease consists of sudden and unpredictable attacks of vertigo. These are usually accompanied by nausea, vomiting and dizziness. You may lose some hearing during the attack, and&nbsp;you may experience&nbsp;tinnitus at the same time. Your ear may also feel blocked and uncomfortable, with a sense of fullness. Some people may also experience sensitivity to sound.</p>\n<p>Attacks of vertigo at this stage can last from 20 minutes to 24 hours, but usually last around two to three hours. Your hearing and the full sensation in your ear usually returns to normal between attacks.</p>\n<h3>Middle stage</h3>\n<p>The middle stage of M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease consists of continuing attacks of vertigo, with the attacks becoming less severe for some people. However, tinnitus and hearing loss often become worse.</p>\n<p>During the middle stage, you may experience some periods of remission (where your symptoms go away), which can last for up to several months. Some people may still experience symptoms of tinnitus, sensitivity to sound or loss of balance between attacks of vertigo.</p>\n<h3>Late stage</h3>\n<p>During the late stage of M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease, the episodes of vertigo occur far less frequently. There may be months or even several years between attacks or&nbsp;they may stop altogether. However, you may be left with balance problems, and you may be unsteady on your feet, particularly in the dark.</p>\n<p>Hearing problems and tinnitus&nbsp;tend to&nbsp;become progressively worse during the late stage of M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease.</p>\n<h2>Causes of Meniere\'s disease</h2>\n<div>\n<p>The exact cause of M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease isn\'t clear, although it\'s thought to be caused by a problem with the pressure in the inner ear.</p>\n<p>The inner ear is made up of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the cochlea &ndash; a coiled, spiral tube that contains two fluid-filled chambers and is responsible for hearing</li>\n<li>the vestibular apparatus &ndash; a complex set of tubes that help to control balance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The fluid inside the inner ear is called endolymph.</p>\n<p>If the pressure of the endolymph fluid changes &ndash; for example, because there is too much fluid &ndash; it can result in symptoms such as&nbsp;<a>vertigo</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a>tinnitus</a>.</p>\n<p>It\'s thought that this pressure change is responsible for M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease, although it hasn\'t been proven.</p>\n<h2>Increased&nbsp;risk</h2>\n<p>Although the exact cause of&nbsp;M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease is unknown, the following factors may increase the risk of developing the condition:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>autoimmunity &ndash; when your immune system attacks your own tissues and organs by mistake</li>\n<li>genetic (inherited) factors &ndash; for example, if you have a family history of the condition</li>\n<li>a chemical imbalance in the fluid in your inner ear&nbsp;&ndash; as a result of too little or too much sodium or potassium in your body</li>\n<li>a problem with the blood vessels &ndash; there\'s a link between M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease and&nbsp;<a>migraines</a>, which are thought to be caused by the narrowing and widening of blood vessels</li>\n<li>some viral infections &ndash; such as&nbsp;<a>meningitis</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Diagnosing Meniere\'s disease</h2>\n<div>\n<p>There\'s no single test for M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease, and the condition can be difficult to distinguish from other conditions with similar symptoms.</p>\n<p>For example,&nbsp;<a>migraines</a>&nbsp;and ear infections can also affect your balance and hearing. A viral infection of the balance nerve (vestibular neuronitis) or the inner ear (<a>labyrinthitis</a>) can also produce similar&nbsp;<a>vertigo</a>&nbsp;attacks.</p>\n<h2>Seeing your GP</h2>\n<p>See your GP if you experience any of the symptoms of M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease.</p>\n<p>They\'ll ask you to describe your symptoms to find out if a pattern is emerging&nbsp;that&nbsp;could indicate M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease.</p>\n<p>For M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease to be diagnosed, you\'ll need to have the following characteristic symptoms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a>vertigo</a>&nbsp;(a feeling that the environment around you is spinning) &ndash; at least two episodes of vertigo lasting 20 minutes or more within a single M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease attack</li>\n<li><a>hearing loss</a>&nbsp;&ndash; tests must confirm that hearing loss is caused by damage to the sensitive hair cells inside the cochlea (the coiled tube in the inner ear)</li>\n<li><a>tinnitus</a>&nbsp;(hearing noises from within your body) or a feeling of pressure in your ear</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your GP&nbsp;may also carry out a general physical examination to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms. This may involve listening to your heartbeat, checking your blood pressure and examining the inside of your ears.</p>\n<h2>Seeing a specialist</h2>\n<p>If necessary, your GP can refer you to a specialist for further tests.</p>\n<p>In most cases, you\'ll probably be referred to an ear nose and throat (ENT) specialist at the ENT department of your local hospital.</p>\n<p>You can also&nbsp;be referred to a specialist in audiovestibular medicine for hearing and balance assessment, although this service may not be available in every hospital.</p>\n<h3>Hearing tests</h3>\n<p>The specialist will be able to assess the extent of your hearing loss by using hearing tests, such as an audiometry test.</p>\n<p>During an audiometry test, you listen to sounds of different volume and pitch produced by a machine and signal when you hear a sound, either by raising your hand or pressing a button.</p>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;<a>how hearing tests are carried out</a></p>\n<h3>Videonystagmography</h3>\n<p>Videonystagmography (VNG) may be used to check for signs of uncontrollable eye movements (nystagmus) because this can indicate a problem with balance.</p>\n<p>During this test, special goggles are placed over your eyes and you\'ll be asked to look at various still and moving targets. The goggles are fitted with a video camera to record your eye movements.</p>\n<h3>Caloric testing</h3>\n<p>A caloric&nbsp;test involves putting warm and cool water or air in your ear for about 30 seconds. The change in temperature stimulates the balance organ in the ear, allowing the specialist to check how well it\'s working.</p>\n<p>This test isn\'t painful, although it\'s normal to feel dizzy for a few minutes afterwards.</p>\n<h3>Electrocochleography</h3>\n<p>Electrocochleography is&nbsp;a test used to measure how your hearing nerves respond to sound.</p>\n<p>During&nbsp;this test, a series of electrodes&nbsp;are attached to your head and&nbsp;a thin probe or&nbsp;needle&nbsp;is&nbsp;passed into your ear so it touches or passes through&nbsp;your eardrum.&nbsp;<a>Local anaesthetic</a>&nbsp;will be used to numb your eardrum before the procedure if a needle is going to be passed through it.</p>\n<p>You will then listen to a series&nbsp;of&nbsp;loud clicks, while the activity of your nerves is picked up by the electrodes and probe or needle.</p>\n<h3>Scans</h3>\n<p>In some cases, a&nbsp;<a>magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan</a>&nbsp;of your head may be carried out to look for any abnormalities in your brain &ndash; such as an acoustic neuroma (a non-cancerous tumour) &ndash; that could be causing your symptoms.</p>\n<h2>Treating Meniere\'s disease</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Treatment can usually help to control the symptoms of M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease, although there\'s currently no cure.</p>\n<p>Your ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist and your GP can help you manage your symptoms. Possible treatments include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>dietary advice&nbsp;&ndash; particularly a low-salt diet</li>\n<li>medication to treat and prevent attacks</li>\n<li><a>treatment for tinnitus</a>&nbsp;</li>\n<li><a>treatment for hearing loss</a></li>\n<li>treatment called vestibular rehabilitation to cope with balance problems</li>\n<li>treatment for stress, anxiety and&nbsp;<a>depression</a></li>\n<li>surgery</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your GP and ENT specialist should provide you with advice tailored to your individual needs, and should develop a plan to&nbsp;help you manage your symptoms.</p>\n<p>In some cases, the treatment available may depend on what your local NHS Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) can provide.</p>\n<h2>Treatment during an attack</h2>\n<p>During an attack of M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease, you may be prescribed medication to treat the symptoms of&nbsp;<a>vertigo</a>, nausea and vomiting.</p>\n<p>This is&nbsp;usually&nbsp;prochlorperazine or an antihistamine. If these work, you may be given a supply to keep, so you can take them quickly during an attack.</p>\n<h3>Prochlorperazine</h3>\n<p>Prochlorperazine can cause side effects including tremors (shaking) and involuntary body or facial movements. It can also make some people feel sleepy.</p>\n<p>Check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine for the full list of possible side effects, or read more about prochlorperazine.</p>\n<p>If you experience vomiting during your attacks, you can take a type of prochlorperazine called Buccastem. This comes as a tablet that you place between your gums and your cheek, on the inside of your mouth. The tablet dissolves and is absorbed into your body.</p>\n<h3>Antihistamines</h3>\n<p>Antihistamines you may be prescribed include cinnarizine, cyclizine&nbsp;and promethazine teoclate.</p>\n<p>Antihistamines can make you feel sleepy. Headaches and an upset stomach are also possible side effects. Check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine for the full list of possible side effects.</p>\n<h3>What to do during an attack</h3>\n<p>During an attack, take your medication as soon as possible and grab the nearest available support. Get into a position in which you feel most stable or comfortable, and keep as still as possible. If you need to move, do so slowly and carefully. Close your eyes or keep them fixed on objects in front of you, and don\'t turn your head quickly.</p>\n<p>Once your symptoms start to improve, it\'s best to gradually try to move around, as this encourages your brain to use your vision and other senses to compensate for the problems in your inner ear.</p>\n<h3>Severe attacks</h3>\n<p>If you suffer severe vertigo, dizziness, nausea and vomiting during an attack of M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease, you may need to be injected with prochlorperazine by your doctor.</p>\n<p>If you suffer severe vertigo with or without nausea during an attack, your doctor may also prescribe you a tablet of Buccastem that dissolves very quickly in your mouth (see above).</p>\n<p>In&nbsp;particularly severe cases, you may need to be admitted to hospital to receive intravenous fluids (through a vein) to keep you hydrated.</p>\n<h2>Preventing attacks</h2>\n<p>Your GP can prescribe a medication called betahistine to help reduce the frequency and severity of attacks of M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease, or you may be advised to change your diet.</p>\n<h3>Special diets</h3>\n<p>Although it has not been proven to be consistently effective, following a diet without added salt can help some people to control their symptoms. It\'s possible that this type of diet might alter the fluids in your inner ear.</p>\n<p>Avoiding excessive caffeine, found in drinks such as tea and coffee, is also usually recommended.</p>\n<h2>Betahistine</h2>\n<p>Betahistine is thought to&nbsp;reduce the pressure of the fluid in your inner ear, relieving the symptoms of M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease. Your GP may recommend trying them to see if they help.</p>\n<p>Betahistines are usually available as tablets to be taken three times a day. Your GP will discuss how long you need to take them for, which could be a few weeks, or up to a year. Possible side effects include a headache, upset stomach and a rash.</p>\n<h2>Treating tinnitus</h2>\n<p>A&nbsp;number of different treatments can be used to treat tinnitus caused by M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease. Some possibilities include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sound therapy &ndash; the effects of tinnitus are often more pronounced in quiet environments. The aim of sound therapy is to fill the silence with neutral, often repetitive sounds to distract you from the sound of tinnitus.</li>\n<li>Relaxation techniques &ndash; tinnitus can be a distressing and intrusive condition. Relaxing by practising&nbsp;<a>yoga</a>&nbsp;or special breathing techniques may help you to avoid stress and anxiety.</li>\n<li>Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) &ndash; this is a therapy based on the knowledge that M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s symptoms can have a significant psychological effect, resulting in negative thoughts and changes in behaviour. This&nbsp;may aggravate your symptoms and create a vicious circle. CBT is given by a specially trained professional who aims to change the way you think and behave, to break this cycle.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Treating hearing loss</h2>\n<p>You may experience permanent hearing loss if M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease is in the middle or end stages. M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease tends to make you more sensitive to loud sounds, and also makes it more difficult for you to distinguish low-pitched sounds.</p>\n<p>There are a variety of hearing aids available. Hearing therapists and organisations, such as&nbsp;<a>Action on Hearing Loss</a>, can provide you with helpful advice for dealing with hearing loss.</p>\n<h2>Vestibular rehabilitation</h2>\n<p>Vestibular rehabilitation (VRT) is usually provided by a hearing specialist or physiotherapist. Your GP may be able to refer you for VRT, although it will depend on the&nbsp;availability in your area.</p>\n<p>A vestibular therapist or specially trained physiotherapist can help improve your balance by teaching you vestibular rehabilitation techniques. These exercises teach you how to cope with the disorientating signals coming from your inner ear. You\'re taught to use alternative signals from your eyes, ankles, legs and neck, to keep you balanced.</p>\n<p>Vestibular therapy is usually used in the middle or late stages of M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease, after the severe attacks of vertigo have stopped, but when balance problems may remain.</p>\n<p>In some cases, it may be possible to use VRT without specialist help. Research has shown that some people can improve their symptoms by using self-help VRT booklets. However, you should discuss this with your doctor first.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Surgery</h2>\n<p>In severe cases, surgery can be performed to control the attacks of vertigo. However, surgical procedures are usually only used if other treatments have failed.</p>\n<p>The type of surgery you have will depend on your symptoms, and whether both ears are affected. You could have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>non-destructive surgery</li>\n<li>selectively destructive surgery</li>\n<li>destructive surgery</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Non-destructive surgery</h3>\n<p>Non-destructive surgery may be used if your hearing in the affected ear is \"socially adequate\" (you can hear sounds that are below 50 decibels). This type of surgery aims to change the progression of M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease by reducing the severity and frequency of your symptoms.</p>\n<p>Types of non-destructive surgery include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>endolymphatic sac decompression &ndash; this can help to reduce the pressure in your inner ear by increasing the drainage of the fluid of your inner ear, although evidence of its effectiveness for&nbsp;M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease is limited</li>\n<li>inserting ventilation tubes (grommets) &ndash; these are inserted into your ear to reduce the changes in pressure that cause M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease</li>\n<li>injecting steroid medication through the eardrum &ndash; although there\'s only limited evidence to suggest&nbsp;that this is an&nbsp;effective treatment</li>\n<li>micropressure therapy &ndash; a newer type of treatment with little evidence regarding its safety and effectiveness; grommets are inserted into your ear and attached to a small pressure generator for a few minutes, several times a day, to alter the pressure in the inner ear</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has more information on&nbsp;<a>micropressure therapy for M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease</a>.</p>\n<h3>Selectively destructive surgery</h3>\n<p>In selectively destructive surgery, the balance part of the inner ear is destroyed with a medicine called gentamicin. This is injected through the ear drum (the thin layer of tissue separating the outer ear from the middle ear) and enters the labyrinth (the system of tubes in the inner ear).</p>\n<p>Gentamicin should mainly damage the balance part of your ear, but there\'s a risk it could damage your hearing as well.</p>\n<p>Some surgeons prefer to apply the gentamicin directly to the inner ear during a minor operation. This means they can control the exact dose of gentamicin that enters your ear.</p>\n<h3>Destructive surgery</h3>\n<p>Destructive surgery may be considered if only one ear is affected by M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease. The hearing in the affected ear must be considered to be \"socially inadequate\" (you can\'t hear enough to function in social situations). As an approximate guide, if you can\'t hear sounds below 50 decibels, this may count as socially inadequate.</p>\n<p>Destructive surgery is used to destroy the part of your inner ear causing your vertigo attacks. However, these operations can cause permanent hearing loss in the treated ear, so will only be considered if you already have permanently reduced hearing in the affected ear.</p>\n<p>Destructive surgery can&nbsp;be done by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>destroying the balance part of your audio-vestibular nerve &ndash; the nerve transmitting sounds and balance information to the brain</li>\n<li>destroying part of your vestibular labyrinth (labyrinthectomy) &ndash; the system of tiny, fluid-filled channels in the ear</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After surgery, your other ear will take over your hearing and balance functions.</p>\n<h3>Safety and effectiveness of surgery</h3>\n<p>There are very few clinical trials looking into the effectiveness of surgery for M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease, which is why surgery is rarely considered. If your ENT specialist thinks you may benefit from having surgery, they\'ll discuss the procedure and any risks in more detail with you.</p>\n<h2>Support groups and charities</h2>\n<p>There are several support groups and charities that can provide you with useful information and advice about living with M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease.

They feel better after taking the pill, because they think they\'re being given real medication.</p>\n<p>Although there\'s limited scientific evidence to suggest that many of the self-help measures and treatments used for M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease are consistently effective, they can help some people to control their symptoms because of the placebo effect.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>','Meniere\'s disease','2023-07-09 11:05:43','2023-07-09 11:05:43',NULL),(46,45,NULL,NULL,'<h1>Nosebleed:</h1>\n<h2>About nosebleeds</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Nosebleeds can be frightening, but they aren\'t usually a sign of anything serious and can often be treated at home.</p>\n<p>The medical name for a nosebleed is epistaxis.</p>\n<p>During a nosebleed, blood flows from one or both&nbsp;nostrils.

It\'s not always possible to identify the exact reason why one occurs.</p>\n<p>Nosebleeds can start just inside your nostrils (anterior) or&nbsp;at the back of&nbsp;your nose (posterior). These different types of nosebleeds tend to have different causes.</p>\n<h2>Anterior nosebleeds</h2>\n<p>The vast majority of&nbsp;nosebleeds are anterior nosebleeds, which means the bleeding comes from&nbsp;the wall between the two nose channels (the lower septum), just inside your nose. This part of the nose, known as Little\'s area, contains many delicate blood vessels that can be easily damaged.</p>\n<p>The cause of anterior nosebleeds is sometimes unknown, but they can be caused by a number of things, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>picking your nose, particularly if you scratch the inside of your nose with a&nbsp;sharp fingernail</li>\n<li>blowing your nose very hard</li>\n<li>a minor injury to your nose</li>\n<li>a blocked or stuffy nose often caused by an infection such as a&nbsp;<a>cold</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>flu</a></li>\n<li>sinusitis&nbsp;&ndash; an infection of the small, air-filled cavities inside your cheekbones and forehead</li>\n<li>dry air or an increase in temperature drying out the inside of your nose</li>\n<li><a >hay fever</a>&nbsp;or other&nbsp;<a>allergies</a></li>\n<li>high altitude</li>\n<li>excessive use of nasal&nbsp;<a>decongestants</a></li>\n<li>a crooked nose that\'s either present from birth (congenital) or the result of an injury (a deviated septum)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anterior nosebleeds are more common in children and are not usually a sign of anything serious. They can often be treated easily at home.</p>\n<h2>Posterior nosebleeds</h2>\n<p>A small number of nosebleeds are posterior nosebleeds, which means the bleeding originates from branches of arteries that supply blood to the space inside your nose between the roof of your mouth and your brain (nasal cavity).</p>\n<p>These nosebleeds are&nbsp;more common in adults than children. They can be more serious than anterior nosebleeds and bleed more heavily. Medical attention may be required.</p>\n<p>Causes of posterior nosebleeds include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a&nbsp;<a >blow to your head</a>, or a&nbsp;<a >fall</a></li>\n<li>a&nbsp;broken nose</li>\n<li>recent nasal surgery</li>\n<li>hardened arteries (atherosclerosis)</li>\n<li>medicines&nbsp;that cause you to bleed more easily, including&nbsp;<a>aspirin</a>&nbsp;and anticoagulants such as&nbsp;warfarin and heparin</li>\n<li>a tumour in the nasal cavity</li>\n<li>a blood clotting abnormality&nbsp;&ndash; such as&nbsp;haemophilia or&nbsp;von Willebrand disease</li>\n<li>hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT)&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;an inherited genetic condition that affects the blood vessels</li>\n<li><a >leukaemia</a>&nbsp;(although this is rare and you\'re likely to have other symptoms as well)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a>High blood pressure (hypertension)</a>&nbsp;is also more common in people with nosebleeds and may make it harder to stop the bleeding, but it\'s not clear whether this directly causes nosebleeds.</p>\n<h2>Treating nosebleeds</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Most nosebleeds can be stopped without the need for medical attention, but occasionally further treatment may be required.</p>\n<h2>What to do</h2>\n<p>To stop a nosebleed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sit down and firmly pinch the soft part of your nose, just above your nostrils, for at least 10-15 minutes</li>\n<li>lean forward and breathe through your mouth&nbsp;&ndash; this will drain blood into&nbsp;your nose instead of down the back of your throat</li>\n<li>place an ice pack or bag of frozen vegetables covered by a towel on the bridge of your nose&nbsp;</li>\n<li>stay upright, rather than lying down as this reduces the blood pressure in the blood vessels of your nose and will discourage further bleeding</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the bleeding eventually stops, you won\'t usually need to seek medical advice.

This may involve looking inside your nose, measuring your pulse and blood pressure, carrying out&nbsp;<a>blood tests</a>&nbsp;and asking about any other symptoms you have.</p>\n<p>The two main treatments that your GP or hospital doctor may use to stop your nose bleeding are cautery and nasal packing. These are described below.</p>\n<h3>Cautery</h3>\n<p>If your doctor is able to identify exactly where the bleeding is coming from, they may carry out a minor procedure to seal the bleeding blood vessel by&nbsp;cauterising (burning)&nbsp;it.</p>\n<p>This is normally done using a stick of a chemical called silver nitrate. A&nbsp;<a>local anaesthetic</a>&nbsp;will be sprayed into your nose to numb it and the silver nitrate stick will be held against the bleeding point for up to 10 seconds.</p>\n<h3>Nasal packing</h3>\n<p>If cautery is ineffective or your doctor is unable to identify a specific bleeding point, they may recommend packing your nose with gauze or special nasal sponges to stop the flow of blood by applying pressure to the source of the bleeding.</p>\n<p>Packing will usually be carried out after&nbsp;local anaesthetic has been sprayed into your nose. The&nbsp;gauze or sponges&nbsp;often need to be left in place for 24-48 hours before being removed by a health professional. You\'ll usually need to be admitted to hospital to be monitored during this time.</p>\n<h3>Further treatment</h3>\n<p>If the treatments above don\'t help, you may be referred to&nbsp;a hospital specialist such as an ear, nose and throat (ENT)&nbsp;doctor for further treatment.</p>\n<p>Additional treatments that may be used in hospital include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>electrocautery &ndash;&nbsp;an electric current running through a wire is used to cauterise the blood vessel where the bleeding is coming from</li>\n<li><a>blood transfusions</a>&nbsp;&ndash; a procedure to&nbsp;replace the blood you\'ve lost</li>\n<li>tranexamic acid &ndash; medication that can reduce bleeding by helping your blood to clot</li>\n<li>packing under anaesthetic &ndash;&nbsp;your nose is carefully&nbsp;packed with gauze while you are unconscious from&nbsp;<a>general anaesthetic</a></li>\n<li>ligation &ndash; an operation&nbsp;using&nbsp;small instruments to tie off&nbsp;bleeding blood vessels in the back of your nose</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Recovery</h2>\n<p>Once your nose has stopped bleeding, you should follow the advice below to reduce the risk of your nose bleeding again and to stop you picking up an infection:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>avoid&nbsp;blowing or picking your nose, heavy lifting, strenuous exercise, lying flat, and drinking alcohol or hot drinks for 24 hours</li>\n<li>don\'t remove any crusts that form inside your nose&nbsp;&ndash; these may be unpleasant, but they\'re a useful part of the healing process</li>\n<li>if you need to sneeze, try to sneeze with your mouth open to reduce the pressure in your nose</li>\n<li>avoid people with coughs and colds</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you see&nbsp;a&nbsp;GP or a&nbsp;hospital doctor about your nosebleed, they&nbsp;may give you a prescription for an antiseptic nasal cream once the bleeding stops. This should be applied to&nbsp;the&nbsp;inside of your&nbsp;nostrils several times a day for up to two weeks to help prevent further bleeding.</p>\n<p>If your nose does start to bleed again, follow the first aid advice above and seek medical advice if the bleeding doesn\'t stop.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>',NULL,'2023-07-09 11:05:43','2023-07-09 11:05:43',NULL),(47,46,NULL,NULL,'<h1>Otitis externa:</h1>\n<h2>About otitis externa</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Otitis externa is a condition that causes inflammation (redness and swelling) of the external ear canal, which is the tube between the outer ear and eardrum.</p>\n<p>Otitis externa is often referred to as \"swimmer\'s ear\" because&nbsp;repeated exposure to water can make the ear canal more vulnerable to inflammation.</p>\n<p>Symptoms of otitis externa include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ear pain, which can be severe</li>\n<li>itchiness in the ear canal</li>\n<li>a discharge of liquid or pus from the ear</li>\n<li>some degree of temporary&nbsp;<a>hearing loss</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Usually only one ear is affected.</p>\n<p>With treatment, these symptoms should clear up within a few days.

They&nbsp;may also examine inside&nbsp;your ear using an instrument called an otoscope.</p>\n<p>If you have recurring episodes of otitis externa that haven\'t responded to treatment, your GP may take a swab of the inside of your ear. This will be tested to help determine what type of infection you have, if any,&nbsp;so appropriate medication can be prescribed.</p>\n<h2>What causes otitis externa?</h2>\n<p>Most cases of otitis externa are caused by a bacterial infection, although&nbsp;the condition&nbsp;can also be caused by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>irritation</li>\n<li>fungal infections</li>\n<li>allergies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are a number of things that can make you more likely to develop otitis externa, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>damaging the skin inside your ear</li>\n<li>regularly getting water in your ear</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Getting water in your ear is particularly significant, because this can cause you to scratch inside your ear, and the moisture also&nbsp;provides an ideal environment for bacteria to grow.</p>\n<h2>Who is affected?</h2>\n<p>Otitis externa is relatively common.

Your GP can usually prescribe medicated ear drops that speed up the healing process. These usually need to be taken several times a day for about a week.</p>\n<p>There are four main types of ear drops used to treat otitis externa:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>antibiotic ear drops&nbsp;&ndash; this can treat an underlying bacterial infection</li>\n<li><a>corticosteroid</a>&nbsp;ear drops&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;this&nbsp;can help to reduce swelling</li>\n<li>antifungal ear drops&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;this can treat an underlying fungal infection</li>\n<li>acidic ear drops &ndash;&nbsp;this can help kill bacteria</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sometimes you may be given medication that\'s a combination of the above, such as antibiotic and corticosteroid ear drops.</p>\n<p>Once treatment is complete and the inflammation has settled, your doctor may want to re-examine your ear to check for any underlying physical problems that could have contributed to the condition, such as having an abnormal or perforated (torn) ear drum.</p>\n<h3>Applying ear drops</h3>\n<p>Ear drops may not work as well if they\'re not used in the right way, so it\'s important to apply them correctly. Ideally, ask somebody else to apply the drops for you, as this makes the process much easier.</p>\n<p>You (or your helper) will need to follow these steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>gently remove any discharge, earwax or debris from your outer ear using a twist of cotton wool</li>\n<li>warm the ear drops by holding them in your hands for a few minutes, as cold ear drops can make you feel dizzy</li>\n<li>lie on your side with your affected ear facing up before applying the drops directly into your external ear canal</li>\n<li>gently push and pull your ear for about 30 seconds to work the drops in and get any trapped air out</li>\n<li>stay lying down for three to five&nbsp;minutes, to ensure the ear drops don\'t come out of your ear canal</li>\n<li>leave the ear canal open to dry</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Other treatments</h3>\n<p>If necessary, there are some other treatments your GP can provide to help treat otitis externa, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>stronger prescription painkillers such as codeine for severe cases</li>\n<li>antibiotic tablets or capsules to treat a severe infection &ndash; an antibiotic called flucloxacillin is usually the preferred choice</li>\n<li>treatment for&nbsp;underlying skin conditions that may aggravate your otitis externa, such as seborrhoeic dermatitis,&nbsp;<a >psoriasis</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>eczema</a></li>\n<li>if a boil develops inside your ear, your GP may decide to pierce it with a sterile needle and drain the pus &ndash; this is known as incision and drainage,&nbsp;and you shouldn\'t&nbsp;attempt to do&nbsp;it yourself</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Specialist treatment</h2>\n<p>If necessary, your GP may refer you to a specialist for further treatment.</p>\n<p>The specialist may decide&nbsp;to remove earwax from inside your ears&nbsp;to help make ear drops more effective. This can be done in a number of ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>syringing or irrigation &ndash; where water is injected through the nozzle of a syringe into the ear canal to dislodge and wash away any earwax</li>\n<li>microsuction &ndash; where a small suction device is used to remove any earwax, discharge and debris from your outer ear and ear canal</li>\n<li>dry swabbing &ndash; this gently mops out earwax from your ear canal</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may also need an ear wick, which is a soft cotton gauze plug covered with medication and inserted into your ear canal.</p>\n<p>An ear wick allows the medication to reach the end of your ear canal. It should be changed every two to three&nbsp;days.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>',NULL,'2023-07-09 11:05:43','2023-07-09 11:05:43',NULL),(48,47,NULL,NULL,'<h1>Sinusitis:</h1>\n<h2>About sinusitis</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Sinusitis is a common condition in which the lining of the sinuses becomes inflamed. It\'s usually caused by a viral infection and often improves within two or three weeks.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;sinuses are small, air-filled cavities behind your cheekbones and forehead.</p>\n<p>The mucus produced by your sinuses usually drains into your nose through small channels. In sinusitis, these channels become blocked because the sinus linings are inflamed (swollen).</p>\n<h2>Signs and symptoms</h2>\n<p>Sinusitis usually occurs after an upper respiratory tract&nbsp;infection, such as a&nbsp;<a>cold</a>. If you have a&nbsp;persistent cold and develop the symptoms below, you may have sinusitis.</p>\n<p>Symptoms of sinusitis&nbsp;include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a green or yellow&nbsp;discharge from your nose</li>\n<li>a blocked nose</li>\n<li>pain and tenderness around your cheeks, eyes or forehead</li>\n<li>a&nbsp;sinus headache</li>\n<li>a high temperature (fever) of&nbsp;38C (100.4F) or more</li>\n<li>toothache</li>\n<li>a reduced sense of smell</li>\n<li>bad breath (halitosis)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Children with sinusitis may be irritable, breathe through their mouth, and have difficulty feeding. Their speech may also sound nasal (as though they have a stuffy cold).</p>\n<p>The symptoms&nbsp;of sinusitis often clear up within a few weeks (acute sinusitis), although occasionally they&nbsp;can last&nbsp;three months or more (chronic sinusitis).</p>\n<h2>When to see your GP</h2>\n<p>If your symptoms are mild and getting better, you don\'t usually need to see your GP and can look after yourself at home.</p>\n<p>See your GP if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>your symptoms are severe or getting worse</li>\n<li>your symptoms haven\'t started to improve after around 7-10 days</li>\n<li>you experience episodes of sinusitis frequently</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your GP will usually be able to diagnose sinusitis from your symptoms and by examining the&nbsp;inside of your nose.</p>\n<p>If you have severe or recurrent sinusitis, they may refer you&nbsp;to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist for further assessment.</p>\n<h2>How&nbsp;sinusitis is treated</h2>\n<p>Most&nbsp;people with sinusitis will feel better within two or three weeks and can look after themselves at home.</p>\n<p>You can help relieve your symptoms by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>taking over-the-counter painkillers such as&nbsp;paracetamol or&nbsp;<a>ibuprofen</a></li>\n<li>using nasal&nbsp;<a>decongestants</a>&nbsp;&ndash; these shouldn\'t be used for more than a week, as this might make things worse</li>\n<li>holding warm packs to your face</li>\n<li>regularly cleaning the inside of your nose with a saline solution&nbsp;&ndash; you can make this at home yourself or use&nbsp;sachets of ingredients bought from a pharmacy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your symptoms aren\'t improving or are getting worse, your GP may prescribe&nbsp;<a>antibiotics</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>corticosteroid</a>&nbsp;spray or drops to see if they help.</p>\n<p>If your symptoms don\'t&nbsp;get better&nbsp;after trying these treatments, you may be referred to an ENT specialist for surgery to improve the drainage of your sinuses.</p>\n<h2>What causes sinusitis?</h2>\n<p>Sinusitis is usually the result of a&nbsp;cold or&nbsp;<a>flu</a>&nbsp;virus spreading to the sinuses from the upper airways. Only a few cases are caused by bacteria infecting the sinuses.</p>\n<p>An infected tooth or fungal infection can also occasionally cause the sinuses to become inflamed.</p>\n<p>It\'s not clear exactly what causes sinusitis to become chronic (long-lasting), but it has been associated with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a>allergies</a>&nbsp;and related conditions,&nbsp;including allergic rhinitis,&nbsp;<a>asthma</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a>hay fever</a></li>\n<li>nasal polyps (growths inside the nose)</li>\n<li>smoking</li>\n<li>a weakened immune system</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Making sure underlying conditions such as allergies and asthma are well controlled may improve the symptoms of chronic sinusitis.</p>\n<h2>Treating sinusitis</h2>\n<div >\n<p>Most people with sinusitis don\'t need to see their GP. The condition is normally caused by a viral infection that clears up on its own.</p>\n<p>Your symptoms will usually pass within two or three weeks (acute sinusitis) and you can look after yourself at home.</p>\n<p>If the condition is severe, gets worse, or doesn\'t improve (chronic sinusitis), you may need additional treatment from your GP or a hospital specialist.&nbsp;This can be difficult to treat and it may be&nbsp;several months before you\'re feeling better.</p>\n<h2>Looking after yourself at home</h2>\n<p>If your symptoms are mild and have&nbsp;lasted less than a week or so, you can usually take care of yourself without seeing your GP.</p>\n<p>The following tips may help you feel better until you recover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take over-the-counter painkillers such as&nbsp;<a>paracetamol</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a>ibuprofen</a>&nbsp;to relieve a high temperature and pain&nbsp;&ndash; check the leaflet that comes with your medication first to check it\'s suitable, and never give aspirin to&nbsp;children under 16 years of age.</li>\n<li>Use&nbsp;over-the-counter&nbsp;<a>decongestant</a>&nbsp;nasal sprays&nbsp;or drops to help unblock your&nbsp;nose and&nbsp;allow you to breathe more easily&nbsp;&ndash; these shouldn\'t be used for more than a week at a time.</li>\n<li>Apply warm packs to your face to soothe your pain and help mucus drain from your sinuses.</li>\n<li>Regularly clean the inside of your nose with a salt water solution to help&nbsp;unblock your nose and reduce nasal discharge.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cleaning inside your nose</h3>\n<p>You can clean the inside of your nose using either a home-made salt water solution or a solution made with sachets of ingredients bought from a pharmacy.</p>\n<p>To make the solution at home, mix a teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda into a pint of boiled water that has been left to cool. To rinse your nose:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>wash and dry your hands</li>\n<li>stand over a sink, cup the palm of one hand and pour a small amount of the solution into it</li>\n<li>sniff the water into one nostril at a time</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Repeat these steps until your nose feels more comfortable (you may not need to use all of the solution). You should make a fresh solution each day. Don\'t re-use a solution made the day before.</p>\n<p>Special devices you can use instead of your hand are also available for pharmacies. If you choose to use one of these, make sure you follow the manufacturer\'s instructions about using and cleaning it.</p>\n<h2>Treatments from your&nbsp;GP</h2>\n<p>See your GP if your symptoms are severe, don\'t start to improve&nbsp;within 7 to 10 days, or are getting worse. They may recommend&nbsp;additional treatment with&nbsp;<a>corticosteroid</a>&nbsp;drops or sprays, or&nbsp;<a>antibiotics</a>.</p>\n<p>If these treatments don\'t help, you GP may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist for an assessment and to discuss whether surgery is a suitable option.</p>\n<h3>Corticosteroid drops or sprays</h3>\n<p>Corticosteroids,&nbsp;also known as&nbsp;steroids, are a group of medications that can help to reduce inflammation.</p>\n<p>If you have persistent symptoms of sinusitis, your GP may prescribe steroid nasal drops or sprays&nbsp;to help reduce the swelling in your sinuses. These may need to be used for several months.</p>\n<p>Possible side effects include nasal irritation, a&nbsp;<a>sore throat</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a >nosebleeds</a>.</p>\n<h3>Antibiotics</h3>\n<p>If your GP thinks your sinuses may be infected with bacteria, they will prescribe a course of antibiotic tablets or capsules to treat the infection.</p>\n<p>You\'ll usually need to take these for&nbsp;a week, although sometimes a longer course may be prescribed.</p>\n<p>Possible side effects of antibiotics include feeling and being sick,&nbsp;<a>diarrhoea</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a>abdominal (tummy) pain</a>.</p>\n<h2>Surgery</h2>\n<p>If your symptoms don\'t improve despite trying the treatments mentioned above, a type of surgery called functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) may be recommended. This is a procedure to improve the drainage of mucus from your sinuses.</p>\n<p>FESS&nbsp;is usually carried out under&nbsp;<a>general anaesthetic</a>. During the procedure, the surgeon will insert an endoscope into your nose. This is a thin tube with a lens at one end that magnifies the inside of your nose. It will allow the surgeon to see the opening of your sinuses and insert small surgical instruments.</p>\n<p>The surgeon will then either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>remove any tissues, such as&nbsp;nasal polyps (growths), that are blocking the affected sinus</li>\n<li>inflate a tiny balloon in the drainage passages from your sinuses to widen them, before the balloon&nbsp;is deflated and removed (this is known as a balloon catheter dilation)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Potential side effects and risks of these procedures include temporary discomfort and crusting inside the nose, bleeding from the nose and infection. Make sure you discuss the risks with your surgeon beforehand.</p>\n<p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) also provides&nbsp;information about&nbsp;<a>balloon catheter dilation for chronic sinusitis</a>.</p>\n<h2>Complications in children</h2>\n<p>Complications of sinusitis are more common in children than in adults. If your child has had sinusitis and has swelling around the cheekbone or eyelid, it may be a bacterial infection of the skin and soft tissue or an infection of the&nbsp;tissue surrounding the eye. Read about&nbsp;<a>cellulitis</a>&nbsp;for more information.</p>\n<p>If you notice these symptoms, take your child to see your GP, who may refer them to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist. Alternatively, you can call&nbsp;<a>NHS 24\'s 111</a>&nbsp;service.</p>\n<h2>Infection of the bone</h2>\n<p>When the condition is severe, antibiotics are often able to control the spread of infection to the nearby bone. However, in very rare cases (about&nbsp;one in 10,000), infection can spread to the area surrounding&nbsp;the eye, the bones, the blood or the brain.</p>\n<h2>Diagnosing sinusitis</h2>\n<div >\n<p>Your GP can usually diagnose sinusitis from your symptoms.</p>\n<p>Sinusitis is nearly always caused by a viral infection, such as the&nbsp;<a>common cold</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>flu</a>, and is diagnosed based on the presence of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>nasal blockage or runny nose with facial pain, and/or</li>\n<li>a reduction or loss of sense of smell</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Loss of smell is more common and facial pain less common&nbsp;in chronic (persistent) sinusitis.</p>\n<h2>Referral to a specialist</h2>\n<p>If your sinusitis is severe or keeps coming back,&nbsp;your GP may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist who will carry out tests to determine the underlying cause.</p>\n<p>You may have&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a>X-ray</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>CT scan</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;find out&nbsp;the cause of your sinusitis (a&nbsp;series of X-rays are taken for a CT scan, to produce a detailed picture of your sinuses).</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>',NULL,'2023-07-09 11:05:43','2023-07-09 11:05:43',NULL),(49,48,NULL,NULL,'<h1>Sore throat:</h1>\n<h2>About sore throats</h2>\n<div >\n<p>Sore throats are very common and usually nothing to worry about.

These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>types A and B of the flu virus</li>\n<li>adenovirus &ndash; which can also cause&nbsp;<a>conjunctivitis</a>, an infection in the eye</li>\n<li>herpes simplex virus type 1 &ndash; which normally causes&nbsp;<a>cold sores</a></li>\n<li>the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) &ndash; which normally causes&nbsp;<a>glandular fever</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are many other,&nbsp;rarer, bacteria and viruses that are each&nbsp;responsible for less than 1% of sore throats.</p>\n<h3>Catching an infection</h3>\n<p>The bacterium or virus that causes a sore throat is usually caught from someone else who is already infected. For example, the common cold is spread through tiny droplets of fluid that contain the cold virus,&nbsp;launched into the air when someone coughs, sneezes or speaks.</p>\n<p>If you breathe in one of these droplets or touch a surface that has the virus on it, and then touch your face, you may become infected.</p>\n<p>Once you have caught an infection, two types of sore throat can develop. These are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>pharyngitis &ndash; when the area at the back of your throat (the oropharynx) becomes inflamed</li>\n<li><a>tonsillitis</a>&nbsp;&ndash; when your tonsils (the two lumps of tissue either side of your throat) become inflamed</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Non-infectious causes</h3>\n<p>Less commonly, sore throats can have non-infectious causes. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>irritation caused by cigarette smoke or alcohol</li>\n<li>irritation from a nasogastric tube (passed down your nose and into your stomach to provide liquid food if you&nbsp;can\'t eat solid food)</li>\n<li><a>gastro-oesophageal reflux disease</a>&nbsp;&ndash; a condition that causes acid to leak upwards from the stomach into the gullet</li>\n<li>Stevens-Johnson syndrome &ndash; a very severe allergic reaction to medication</li>\n<li><a>Kawasaki disease</a>&nbsp;&ndash; a rare condition that affects children under five years of age</li>\n<li><a >allergies</a>&nbsp;&ndash; such as&nbsp;<a>hay fever</a>&nbsp;(an allergic reaction to pollen or spores) which, in rare cases, may also cause a sore throat</li>\n<li>some blood disorders, such as leukaemia (cancer of the bone marrow) or aplastic anaemia (when the bone marrow does not produce enough blood cells)</li>\n<li>oral mucositis (inflammation of the layer of tissue that lines your mouth), which can be caused by radiotherapy or chemotherapy (cancer treatments)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Treating a sore throat</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Sore throats are not usually serious and often pass in three to seven days. There are some treatments you can use at home to relieve your symptoms.</p>\n<h2>When to see your GP</h2>\n<p>You should see your GP if you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>fall into one of the groups of people at risk of developing complications &ndash; this includes anyone with a weakened immune system due to medication, or a condition such as&nbsp;<a>HIV</a></li>\n<li>have persistent symptoms that are not improving or responding to self-care</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Visit your nearest&nbsp;<a>accident and emergency department (A&amp;E)</a>&nbsp;or call 999 for an ambulance if you have severe symptoms such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>difficulty breathing or swallowing</li>\n<li>severe pain</li>\n<li>drooling</li>\n<li>a muffled voice</li>\n<li>a high-pitched sound as you breathe (stridor)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;<a>when to visit your GP</a>.</p>\n<h2>Painkillers</h2>\n<p>For treating sore throats, over-the-counter painkillers, such as&nbsp;<a>paracetamol</a>, are usually recommended. These may also help reduce a high temperature (fever).</p>\n<p>You should not take&nbsp;<a>aspirin</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>ibuprofen</a>&nbsp;if you have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a>asthma</a></li>\n<li>current or past stomach problems, such as a&nbsp;<a>stomach ulcer</a></li>\n<li>current or past liver or kidney problems</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Children under the age of 16 should never be given aspirin.</p>\n<p>Take painkillers as necessary to relieve your pain. Always read the manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions so you do not exceed the recommended or prescribed dose.</p>\n<h2>Self-care tips</h2>\n<p>If you or someone in your family has a sore throat, the tips below may help relieve the symptoms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>avoid food or drink that is too hot, as this could irritate the throat</li>\n<li>eat cool, soft food and drink cool or warm liquids</li>\n<li>adults and older children can suck lozenges, hard sweets, ice cubes or ice lollies</li>\n<li>avoid smoking and smoky environments</li>\n<li>regularly gargling with a mouthwash of warm, salty water may help reduce swelling or pain</li>\n<li>drink enough fluids, especially if you have a fever</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Steam inhalation is not recommended, as it\'s unlikely to help a sore throat and there is a risk of scalding.</p>\n<h2>Antibiotics</h2>\n<p>The use of&nbsp;<a>antibiotics</a>&nbsp;is not usually recommended for treating sore throats. This is because most sore throats are not caused by bacteria.</p>\n<p>Even if your sore throat is caused by bacteria, antibiotics have very little effect on the severity of the symptoms and how long they last, and may cause unpleasant&nbsp;<a>side effects</a>.</p>\n<p>Overusing antibiotics to treat minor ailments can also make them less effective in the treatment of life-threatening conditions. This is known as antibiotic resistance.</p>\n<p>Antibiotics are usually only prescribed if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>your sore throat is particularly severe</li>\n<li>you are at increased risk of a severe infection &ndash; for example&nbsp;because you have a weakened immune system due to HIV or&nbsp;<a>diabetes</a>&nbsp;(a long-term condition caused by too much glucose in the blood)</li>\n<li>you are at risk of having a weakened immune system &ndash; there are some medications that can cause this, such as carbimazole (to treat an&nbsp;<a>overactive thyroid gland</a>)</li>\n<li>you have a history of rheumatic fever (a condition that can cause widespread inflammation throughout the body)</li>\n<li>you have valvular heart disease (a disease affecting the valves in your heart, which control blood flow)</li>\n<li>you experience repeated infections caused by the group A streptococcus bacteria</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Delayed antibiotics prescription</h3>\n<p>If your GP thinks you might need antibiotics, they may issue a prescription but ask you to wait up to three days for symptoms to improve.</p>\n<p>If your sore throat gets worse, or has not improved after three days, you should have instructions to either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>take your prescription slip to a pharmacy</li>\n<li>return to the GP surgery after three days to collect your medication</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Recent studies show that complications of a sore throat are&nbsp;uncommon and usually not serious. A delayed antibiotic prescription seems to be as effective as an immediate prescription in reducing complications.</p>\n<p>Using a&nbsp;delayed prescription provides similar benefits to an immediate prescription. Most importantly, this&nbsp;helps you to avoid taking antibiotics when they\'re not needed and helps&nbsp;prevent antibiotic resistance.</p>\n<h2>Tonsillectomy</h2>\n<p>A tonsillectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the tonsils (the two lumps of tissue on either side of your throat). If your child has repeated infections of the tonsils (tonsillitis), a tonsillectomy may be considered.</p>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;<a>treating tonsillitis</a>.</p>\n<h2>Persistent sore throat</h2>\n<p>If you have a persistent sore throat (one that lasts three to four weeks), your GP may refer you for further tests. This is because your sore throat may be a symptom of a more serious condition. Some possibilities are described below.</p>\n<h3>Glandular fever</h3>\n<p>If you are 15-25 years of age with a persistent sore throat, you may have&nbsp;<a>glandular fever</a>&nbsp;(also known as infectious mononucleosis, or mono). This is a type of viral infection with symptoms that can last up to six weeks.</p>\n<h3>Cancer</h3>\n<p>A persistent sore throat can also be a symptom of some types of cancer, such as throat cancer. This type of cancer is rare and mainly affects people over the age of 50. In the UK every year, 5,300 people are diagnosed with cancer of the oropharynx (the area at the back of your throat) or mouth.</p>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;<a>mouth cancer</a></p>\n<h2>Non-infectious causes</h2>\n<p>In some cases, a sore throat may be caused by substances that irritate the throat.

For some people it may come and go and only be a&nbsp;minor irritation.</p>\n<p>However,&nbsp;it can sometimes be continuous and have a significant impact on everyday life. Severe cases&nbsp;can&nbsp;be very distressing,&nbsp;affect concentration, and cause problems such as difficulty sleeping&nbsp;<a>(insomnia)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a>depression</a>.</p>\n<p>In many cases, tinnitus will get better gradually over time. But it\'s important to seek medical advice to see if an underlying cause can be found and treated, and to help you find ways to cope with the problem.</p>\n<h2>When to see your GP</h2>\n<p>You should see your GP if you continually or regularly hear sounds such as buzzing, ringing or humming in your ears.</p>\n<p>They can examine your ears to see if the problem might be caused by a condition&nbsp;they could easily treat, such as an&nbsp;<a>ear&nbsp;infection</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>earwax build-up</a>. They can also do some simple checks to see if you have any&nbsp;<a>hearing loss</a>.</p>\n<p>If necessary, your GP can refer you to a hospital specialist for further tests and treatment.</p>\n<h2>What causes tinnitus?</h2>\n<p>Tinnitus&nbsp;can develop gradually over time or occur suddenly. It\'s not clear exactly why it happens, but it often occurs along with&nbsp;some degree of hearing loss.</p>\n<p>Tinnitus is often associated with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>age-related hearing loss</li>\n<li>inner ear damage caused by repeated exposure to loud noises</li>\n<li>an&nbsp;earwax build-up</li>\n<li>a middle ear&nbsp;infection</li>\n<li><a >M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease</a>&nbsp;&ndash; a condition that also causes hearing loss and&nbsp;<a>vertigo</a>&nbsp;(a spinning sensation)</li>\n<li>otosclerosis&nbsp;&ndash; an inherited condition where an abnormal bone growth in the middle ear causes hearing loss</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However,&nbsp;around one in every three people with tinnitus doesn\'t have any obvious problem with their ears or hearing.</p>\n<h2>Who is affected?</h2>\n<p>Most people have experienced short periods of tinnitus after&nbsp;being exposed to loud noises, such as after a&nbsp;music concert.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the UK, more persistent tinnitus is estimated to affect around&nbsp;six million people (10% of the&nbsp;population) to some degree, with about 600,000 (1%) experiencing it to a severity that&nbsp;affects their quality of life.</p>\n<p>Tinnitus can affect people of all ages, including children, but is more common&nbsp;in people aged over 65.</p>\n<h2>Treating tinnitus</h2>\n<p>There\'s currently no single treatment for tinnitus that works for everyone. However, research to find an effective treatment is continuing.</p>\n<p>If an&nbsp;underlying cause of your tinnitus can be found, effectively treating&nbsp;it may help improve your tinnitus&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;for example,&nbsp;removing a&nbsp;build-up of earwax&nbsp;might help.</p>\n<p>If a specific&nbsp;cause can\'t be found, treatment will focus on helping you manage the condition on a daily basis. This may involve:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sound therapy &ndash; listening to neutral sounds to distract you from the sound of tinnitus</li>\n<li>counselling&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;therapy that&nbsp;aims to educate you about tinnitus and help you&nbsp;learn to cope with it more effectively</li>\n<li>cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)&nbsp;&ndash; therapy that aims to help change the way you think about your tinnitus so it becomes less noticeable</li>\n<li>tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) &ndash;&nbsp;therapy that aims to help retrain the way your brain responds to tinnitus so you start to tune the sound out and become less aware of it</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Causes of tinnitus</h2>\n<div>\n<p>It\'s not clear exactly what causes tinnitus, but it\'s thought to be a problem with how the ear hears sounds and how the brain interprets them.</p>\n<p>Many cases are associated with&nbsp;<a>hearing loss</a>&nbsp;caused by damage to the inner ear, although around one person in every three with the condition doesn\'t have any obvious problem with their ears or hearing.</p>\n<h2>Inner ear&nbsp;damage</h2>\n<p>Sounds pass from the outer ear through to the inner ear, which contains the&nbsp;cochlea and auditory nerve. The cochlea is a coiled, spiral tube containing a large number of sensitive hair cells. The auditory nerve transmits sound signals to the brain.</p>\n<p>If part of the cochlea is damaged, it will stop sending information to your brain. The&nbsp;brain&nbsp;may then actively \"seek out\" signals from parts of the cochlea that still work. These signals&nbsp;might then&nbsp;become over-represented in the brain, which&nbsp;may cause the sounds of tinnitus.</p>\n<p>In older people, damage to the cochlea often occurs naturally with age. In younger people, it can be caused by&nbsp;repeated exposure to excessive noise.</p>\n<h2>Other causes</h2>\n<p>As well as inner ear&nbsp;damage, there are several other possible causes of tinnitus. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>an&nbsp;<a>earwax build-up</a>&nbsp;that blocks&nbsp;the ear</li>\n<li>a&nbsp;<a >middle ear infection</a></li>\n<li>glue ear&nbsp;&ndash; a build-up of fluid in the middle ear</li>\n<li>a perforated eardrum</li>\n<li><a>M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease</a>&nbsp;&ndash; a condition that also causes hearing loss and&nbsp;<a>vertigo</a>&nbsp;(a spinning sensation)</li>\n<li>otosclerosis&nbsp;&ndash; an inherited&nbsp;condition where an abnormal bone growth in the middle ear causes hearing loss</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Rarer causes</h2>\n<p>Less commonly, tinnitus may develop as a result of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a&nbsp;<a >head injury</a></li>\n<li>exposure to a sudden or very loud noise, such as an explosion or&nbsp;gunfire</li>\n<li><a>anaemia</a>&nbsp;&ndash; a reduced number of red blood cells that can sometimes cause the blood to thin and circulate so rapidly that it produces a sound</li>\n<li>reactions to certain medications, such as some&nbsp;<a>chemotherapy</a>&nbsp;medicines,&nbsp;<a>antibiotics</a>, diuretics,&nbsp;<a>non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</a>&nbsp;and aspirin (this is more likely to occur at very high doses)</li>\n<li>acoustic neuroma&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;a rare non-cancerous growth that affects the hearing nerve in the inner ear</li>\n<li>high blood pressure&nbsp;<a>(hypertension)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis)</li>\n<li>an overactive thyroid gland&nbsp;<a>(hyperthyroidism)</a>&nbsp;or underactive thyroid gland&nbsp;<a>(hypothyroidism)</a></li>\n<li><a>diabetes</a></li>\n<li>Paget\'s disease&nbsp;&ndash; where the normal cycle of bone renewal and repair is disrupted</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Diagnosing tinnitus</h2>\n<div>\n<p>You should see your GP if you have a problem with your hearing, such as hearing ringing or buzzing sounds.</p>\n<p>They will ask you some questions about your symptoms, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does the sound&nbsp;come and go, or&nbsp;is it&nbsp;continuous?</li>\n<li>Does the problem affect one or both ears?</li>\n<li>Is&nbsp;the problem having an impact on your everyday life?</li>\n<li>Have you noticed any other&nbsp;symptoms, such as hearing loss or&nbsp;<a>vertigo</a>&nbsp;(a spinning sensation)?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>They may also want to know whether you\'re taking any medication that could cause the condition, such as high doses of&nbsp;<a>antibiotics</a>&nbsp;or aspirin.</p>\n<p>They will examine the outside and inside of your ear to check for obvious problems they may be able to treat, such as an&nbsp;<a>earwax build-up</a>&nbsp;or an&nbsp;<a>ear&nbsp;infection</a>.</p>\n<p>They might also carry out a simple test of your hearing and arrange&nbsp;<a>blood tests</a>&nbsp;to look for conditions sometimes associated with tinnitus, such as&nbsp;<a>anaemia</a>&nbsp;(a reduction in red blood cells),&nbsp;<a >diabetes</a>&nbsp;or a problem with your thyroid gland.</p>\n<h2>Seeing a specialist</h2>\n<p>In some cases, your GP may refer you to a hearing specialist called an audiologist, who can carry out&nbsp;a range of&nbsp;hearing tests and&nbsp;talk to you about the treatments available.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you may be referred to the ear, nose and throat (ENT) department of your hospital.</p>\n<p>At your appointment, an ENT specialist will examine your ears, ask you about the type and severity of the noises you can hear, and carry out tests to try to establish what\'s causing them.</p>\n<p>Very occasionally, you may have a&nbsp;<a>computerised tomography (CT) scan</a>&nbsp;or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. These scans will allow the specialist to closely examine the inside of your ear and brain.</p>\n<h2>Treating tinnitus</h2>\n<div>\n<p>There\'s not usually a quick fix for tinnitus, but it will often improve gradually over time. A number of treatments are available to help you cope.</p>\n<p>If your tinnitus is caused by an underlying health condition, treating the condition will help stop or reduce the sounds you hear.</p>\n<p>For example, if your tinnitus is caused by an&nbsp;<a>earwax build-up</a>, eardrops or ear irrigation may be used. Ear irrigation involves using a pressurised flow of water to remove the earwax.</p>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;<a>how&nbsp;an earwax build-up is treated</a>.</p>\n<p>However, in many cases a cause for&nbsp;tinnitus can\'t be found, so treatments will be used to help you manage the&nbsp;problem on a&nbsp;daily basis. These are described below.</p>\n<h2>Correcting hearing loss</h2>\n<p>Any degree of&nbsp;<a>hearing loss</a>&nbsp;you have should be addressed because straining to listen can make tinnitus worse.</p>\n<p>Correcting even fairly minor hearing loss means the parts of the brain involved in hearing don\'t have to work as hard and therefore don\'t pay as much attention to the tinnitus.</p>\n<p>A&nbsp;specialist will test your hearing and recommend appropriate treatment. This could&nbsp;involve having a&nbsp;<a>hearing aid</a>&nbsp;fitted, and occasionally&nbsp;surgery.</p>\n<p>Improving your hearing will also mean sounds you wouldn\'t otherwise hear will now be audible, which&nbsp;may help override the sounds of your tinnitus.</p>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;<a>treating hearing loss</a>.</p>\n<h2>Sound therapy</h2>\n<p>Tinnitus is often most noticeable in quiet environments. The aim of \"sound therapy\" or \"sound enrichment\" is to fill any silence with neutral sounds to distract you from the sound of tinnitus.</p>\n<p>This may involve simple measures such as opening a window to hear noises coming from outside, leaving a radio or television on, or listening to&nbsp;sounds&nbsp;on a portable music player.</p>\n<p>You can get specially-designed sound generators&nbsp;that look similar to a radio. These produce quiet natural sounds, such as&nbsp;leaves rustling in the wind and waves lapping on&nbsp;the shore. White noise generators are similar devices that produce a continuous \"shushing\" sound at a level that\'s comfortable and soothing.</p>\n<p>Also available are pillows containing built-in speakers to help distract you from tinnitus when you go to sleep, and small sound-generator devices that fit in your ear like a hearing aid. Some hearing aids have built-in sound generators for people with tinnitus.</p>\n<h2>Counselling</h2>\n<p>Understanding tinnitus&nbsp;plays an&nbsp;important part in learning how to cope with the condition and manage it&nbsp;more effectively.</p>\n<p>Tinnitus counseling&nbsp;is a type of therapy where you work with a healthcare professional to help you learn more about your tinnitus and find ways of coping with it. It\'s usually carried out by hearing therapists, audiologists (hearing disorder specialists) or doctors.</p>\n<h2>Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)</h2>\n<p>Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)&nbsp;is often used to treat mental health problems, such as anxiety&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a>depression</a>. It\'s based on the idea that your&nbsp;thoughts affect the way you&nbsp;behave. Treatment aims to retrain the way you think to change your behaviour.</p>\n<p>This technique can be effectively applied to tinnitus.&nbsp;For example, if your knowledge about tinnitus is limited,&nbsp;you may have certain ideas about it that make you feel anxious and depressed. This can make your tinnitus worse.</p>\n<p>Changing the way you think about your tinnitus and what you do about it can help reduce your anxiety and enable you&nbsp;to accept&nbsp;the noises, which after a while may become&nbsp;less noticeable.</p>\n<h2>Tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT)</h2>\n<p>Tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) is a special type of therapy that aims to help retrain the way your brain responds to tinnitus so you start to tune the sound out and become less aware of it. The therapy involves a combination of more intensive sound therapy and long-term counselling.</p>\n<p>TRT is widely available privately and may be available on the NHS for people with very severe or persistent tinnitus. It should only be carried out by someone specially trained in the technique.</p>\n<h2>Self-help</h2>\n<p>Some people find&nbsp;self-help techniques useful for managing their tinnitus. These techniques include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>relaxation &ndash; stress can make your tinnitus worse,&nbsp;so relaxation techniques&nbsp;such as deep breathing and&nbsp;<a>yoga</a>&nbsp;may help</li>\n<li>listening to music &ndash; calming music and sounds may help you relax and&nbsp;fall asleep at bedtime</li>\n<li>sleep hygiene &ndash; if tinnitus is affecting your sleep,&nbsp;sleep hygiene measures such as sticking to a&nbsp;regular sleep pattern and avoiding caffeine or alcohol shortly before going to bed may help</li>\n<li>hobbies and activities &ndash; having a hobby or regularly participating in any activity you find enjoyable may help distract you from tinnitus</li>\n<li>support groups &ndash; sharing your experiences with others who have tinnitus may help you cope better</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>',NULL,'2023-07-09 11:05:43','2023-07-09 11:05:43',NULL),(51,50,NULL,NULL,'<h1>Tonsillitis:</h1>\n<h2>About tonsillitis</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Tonsillitis is inflammation of the tonsils. It\'s usually caused by a viral infection or, less commonly, a bacterial infection.</p>\n<p>Tonsillitis is a common condition in children, teenagers and young adults.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<a>symptoms of tonsillitis</a>&nbsp;include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a&nbsp;<a>sore throat</a>&nbsp;and pain when&nbsp;swallowing</li>\n<li><a>earache</a></li>\n<li>high temperature (fever) over 38C (100.4F)</li>\n<li><a>coughing</a></li>\n<li><a>headache</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Symptoms usually pass within three to four days.</p>\n<h2>When to see your GP</h2>\n<p>Tonsillitis isn\'t usually a serious condition. You only need to see your GP if symptoms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>last longer than four days and don\'t show any signs of improvement</li>\n<li>are severe &ndash; for example, if you\'re unable to eat or drink due to the pain, or you have difficulty breathing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your GP will examine your throat and ask you some questions about your symptoms. If necessary, a throat swab can be taken to confirm the diagnosis. The results usually take a few days to return.</p>\n<p>If your tonsillitis is caused by a bacterial infection, they may prescribe&nbsp;<a>antibiotics</a>. Typical signs of a bacterial infection include white pus-filled spots on&nbsp;the tonsils, no cough and swollen&nbsp;or tender lymph glands.</p>\n<p>If you develop severe tonsillitis as a teenager or adult, your GP may recommend a&nbsp;<a>blood test</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a >glandular fever.</a></p>\n<h2>The tonsils</h2>\n<p>The tonsils are two small glands that sit on either side of the throat. In young children, they help to fight&nbsp;germs and act as a barrier against infection.</p>\n<p>When the tonsils become infected, they isolate the infection and stop it spreading further into the body.</p>\n<p>As a child\'s&nbsp;immune system develops and gets stronger, the tonsils become less important and usually shrink. In most people, the body is able to fight infection without the tonsils.</p>\n<p>Removal of the&nbsp;tonsils&nbsp;is usually only recommended if they\'re causing problems, such as severe or repeated episodes of tonsillitis (see below).</p>\n<h2>What causes tonsillitis?</h2>\n<p>Most cases of tonsillitis are caused by a viral infection, such as the viruses that cause the&nbsp;<a>common cold</a>&nbsp;or flu virus (<a>influenza</a>).</p>\n<p>Some cases can also be caused by a bacterial infection, typically a strain of bacteria called group A streptococcus bacteria.</p>\n<p>These types of infections spread easily, so it\'s important to try to avoid passing the infection on to others by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>staying away from public places, such as work, school or nursery, until your GP says it\'s safe to return (usually after the symptoms have passed)</li>\n<li>coughing and sneezing into a tissue and disposing of the tissue&nbsp;</li>\n<li>washing hands before eating, after going to the toilet and, if possible, after coughing and sneezing</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Treating tonsillitis</h2>\n<p>There\'s no specific treatment for tonsillitis, but you may be able to reduce the symptoms by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>taking&nbsp;<a>paracetamol</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>ibuprofen</a>&nbsp;to help relieve pain</li>\n<li>drinking plenty of fluids</li>\n<li>getting plenty of rest</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If test results show that your tonsillitis is caused by a bacterial infection, a short course of oral antibiotics may be prescribed.</p>\n<p>If oral antibiotics aren\'t effective at treating bacterial tonsillitis, intravenous antibiotics (given directly into a vein) may be needed in hospital.</p>\n<h3>Chronic tonsillitis</h3>\n<p>In most cases, tonsillitis gets better within a week. However, a small number of children and adults have tonsillitis for longer, or it keeps returning. This is known as chronic tonsillitis and surgical treatment may be needed.</p>\n<p>Surgery to remove the tonsils (a tonsillectomy) is usually only recommended&nbsp;if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you\'ve had several severe episodes of tonsillitis over a long period of time</li>\n<li>repeated episodes are disrupting normal activities</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Complications of tonsillitis</h2>\n<p>Complications of tonsillitis are rare and usually only occur if it\'s caused by a bacterial infection. They\'re usually the result of the infection spreading to another part of the body.</p>\n<p>Possible complications of tonsillitis include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a&nbsp;<a>middle ear infection (otitis media)</a>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;where fluid between the eardrum and inner ear becomes infected by bacteria</li>\n<li>quinsy (peritonsillar abscess)&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;an&nbsp;abscess (collection of pus) that develops between one of the tonsils and the wall of the throat</li>\n<li><a >obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA)</a>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;where the walls of the throat relax during sleep, which causes breathing difficulties and&nbsp;poor sleep</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other complications of tonsillitis are very rare and usually only occur if an underlying bacterial infection is left untreated. They include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a >scarlet fever</a>&nbsp;&ndash; a condition that causes a distinctive pink-red skin rash</li>\n<li>rheumatic fever&nbsp;&ndash; this causes widespread inflammation throughout the body, leading to symptoms such as joint pain, rashes and jerky body movements</li>\n<li>glomerulonephritis&nbsp;&ndash; an infection (swelling) of the filters in the kidneys that can cause vomiting and a loss of appetite</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Symptoms of tonsillitis</h2>\n<div >\n<p>The main symptom of tonsillitis is a&nbsp;<a>sore throat</a>.</p>\n<p>Your tonsils will be red and swollen, and your throat may be very painful, making swallowing difficult.</p>\n<p>In some cases, the tonsils are coated or have white, pus-filled spots on them.</p>\n<p>Other common symptoms of tonsillitis&nbsp;include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>high temperature (fever) over 38C (100.4F)</li>\n<li><a>coughing</a></li>\n<li><a>headache</a></li>\n<li><a>earache</a></li>\n<li>feeling sick</li>\n<li>feeling tired</li>\n<li>swollen, painful&nbsp;lymph glands in your neck</li>\n<li>loss of voice or changes to your voice</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The symptoms of tonsillitis usually get better after three to four days.</p>\n<p>If&nbsp;you have tonsillitis that\'s caused by&nbsp;a viral infection, such as the&nbsp;<a>common cold</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>flu</a>,&nbsp;your symptoms may be milder.</p>\n<p>If your tonsillitis is caused by a bacterial infection, such as a streptococcal infection, your symptoms will usually be more severe and you may also have bad breath.</p>\n<p>It\'s difficult to tell just by looking at a person\'s throat whether they have tonsillitis as a&nbsp;result of a virus or a bacterial infection. Tests are needed to confirm this.</p>\n<p><a>Antibiotics</a>&nbsp;may be recommended if test results show that your tonsillitis is caused by a bacterial infection.</p>\n<h2>Causes of tonsillitis</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Most cases of tonsillitis are caused by a viral infection.</p>\n<p>Viruses known to cause tonsillitis include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>rhinoviruses &ndash; which cause the&nbsp;<a>common cold</a></li>\n<li>the&nbsp;<a>influenza</a>&nbsp;virus</li>\n<li>parainfluenza virus &ndash; which causes&nbsp;<a>laryngitis</a>&nbsp;and croup</li>\n<li>enteroviruses &ndash; which cause&nbsp;<a>hand, foot and mouth disease</a></li>\n<li>adenovirus &ndash; which is a common cause of&nbsp;<a>diarrhoea</a></li>\n<li>the rubeola virus &ndash; which causes&nbsp;<a>measles</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In rare cases, tonsillitis can also be caused by the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes&nbsp;<a>glandular fever</a>.</p>\n<p>If this is the case, you\'ll probably&nbsp;feel very ill. You\'ll have a&nbsp;<a >sore throat</a>&nbsp;and the lymph glands in your throat may be swollen. You may also have a fever and feel very tired.</p>\n<h2>Bacterial tonsillitis</h2>\n<p>Bacterial tonsillitis can&nbsp;be caused by a number of different bacteria, but it\'s usually due to group A streptococcus bacteria.</p>\n<p>In the past, serious bacterial infections, such as diphtheria and rheumatic fever, have been linked with tonsillitis. However, this is now rare, because these conditions are vaccinated against and treatment for them has greatly improved.</p>\n<h2>How tonsillitis is spread</h2>\n<p>Tonsillitis itself isn\'t contagious, but the infections that cause it are.</p>\n<p>Viruses, such as those that cause colds and flu, are spread through coming into close contact with someone who\'s infected.</p>\n<p>When an infected person coughs or sneezes, the virus is contained in the millions of tiny droplets that come out of their nose and mouth. You can become infected by breathing in the contaminated droplets. This is known as direct contact.</p>\n<p>You can also become infected if you touch a surface or object that the droplets have landed on and then touch your face. This is known as indirect contact.</p>\n<h2>Treating tonsillitis</h2>\n<div>\n<p>There\'s no specific treatment for tonsillitis and most cases get better within a week without treatment.</p>\n<p>While waiting for the infection to clear up, there are a number of things you can do to help relieve your symptoms (see below).</p>\n<p>If your child has tonsillitis, make sure they have plenty to eat and drink, even if they find it painful to swallow. Being hungry and dehydrated can make other symptoms, such as&nbsp;<a>headaches</a>&nbsp;and tiredness, worse.</p>\n<h2>Self-help</h2>\n<p>Over-the-counter painkillers, such as&nbsp;<a >paracetamol</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a>ibuprofen</a>, can help relieve painful symptoms such as a&nbsp;<a>sore throat</a>.</p>\n<p>If treating your children with painkillers, it\'s important to use the correct type and dosage. Younger children only need small dosages. Your pharmacist can advise you about this.</p>\n<p>Children under 16 years of age shouldn\'t be given aspirin.</p>\n<p>Over-the-counter treatments that can soothe a sore throat, such as lozenges and oral sprays, are also available. Some people find that gargling with a mild antiseptic solution can also relieve a sore throat.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you could try gargling with warm, salty water. Mix half a teaspoon of salt (2.5g) with a quarter of a litre (eight ounces) of water. It\'s important not to swallow the water, so this method may not be suitable for younger children.</p>\n<h2>Antibiotics</h2>\n<p><a>Antibiotics</a>&nbsp;may not be prescribed, even if tests confirm your tonsillitis is caused by a bacterial infection. The two main reasons for this are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>in most cases, antibiotics won\'t speed up the recovery, but they can cause unpleasant side effects, such as stomach pain and feeling sick</li>\n<li>the more an antibiotic is used to treat a non-serious infection, the greater the chance it won\'t be effective in treating more serious infections; this is known as antibiotic resistance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, exceptions are usually&nbsp;made if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>symptoms are severe</li>\n<li>symptoms show no sign of easing</li>\n<li>you or your child has&nbsp;a weakened immune system</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In these circumstances, a 10-day course of penicillin is usually recommended. If you or your child is known to be allergic to penicillin, an alternative antibiotic, such as erythromycin, can be used.</p>\n<p>Hospital treatment may be required for particularly severe or persistent cases of bacterial tonsillitis that don\'t respond to oral antibiotics. In these cases, intravenous antibiotics (given directly into a vein) may be needed.</p>\n<p>Antibiotics sometimes cause mild side effects, such as an upset stomach,&nbsp;<a>diarrhoea</a>&nbsp;or a rash.</p>\n<h3>Surgery</h3>\n<p>Surgery to remove the tonsils is known as a tonsillectomy.</p>\n<p>For children with mild sore throats, watchful waiting is recommended rather than a tonsillectomy.</p>\n<p>A tonsillectomy is only considered for a recurrent sore throat if certain criteria are met. You must have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a sore throat caused by tonsillitis</li>\n<li>episodes of sore throat that are disabling and stop you functioning normally</li>\n<li>seven&nbsp;or more well-documented, clinically significant, adequately treated sore throats in the preceding year or</li>\n<li>five or more such episodes in each of the preceding two years&nbsp;<strong>or</strong></li>\n<li>three or more such episodes in each of the preceding three years</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tonsillectomies are carried out&nbsp;under&nbsp;<a>general anaesthetic</a>, which means you\'ll be asleep during the procedure. Your mouth will be held open to allow the surgeon to see your tonsils and no cuts will be made in your skin.</p>\n<p>The operation can be carried out in a number of ways, as described below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cold steel surgery &ndash; this is the most common method, where a surgical blade is used to cut the tonsils out. Bleeding is controlled by applying pressure or the blood vessels may be sealed using heat generated by diathermy.</li>\n<li>Diathermy &ndash; a diathermy probe is used to destroy the tissue around the tonsils and to remove the tonsils. At the same time, the heat seals the blood vessels to stop any bleeding.</li>\n<li>Coblation (or cold ablation) &ndash; this method works in a similar way to diathermy, but uses a lower temperature (60C). It\'s considered less painful than diathermy.</li>\n<li>Lasers &ndash;&nbsp;high-energy laser beams are used to cut away the tonsils and seal the underlying blood vessels shut.</li>\n<li>Ultrasound &ndash; high-energy ultrasound waves are used in a similar way to lasers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of these techniques is relatively similar in terms of safety, results and recovery, so the type of surgery used will depend on the expertise and training of the surgeon.</p>\n<p>You\'ll usually be able to leave hospital on the same day as you have surgery, or the day after.</p>\n<h3>After surgery</h3>\n<p>After surgery, it\'s likely you\'ll experience some pain at the site of the operation. This can last for up to a week. Painkillers can help to relieve the pain.</p>\n<p>Children who have had a tonsillectomy should be kept off school for two weeks. This is to reduce their risk of picking up an infection from another child that will make them feel more uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>Swallowing will probably be difficult after having a tonsillectomy. However, it\'s important to eat solid foods, because it will help your throat to heal more quickly. Drink plenty of fluids, but avoid acidic drinks, such as orange juice, because they\'ll sting.</p>\n<p>Ensuring good oral hygiene by regularly brushing your teeth and using mouthwash can help prevent infection in the mouth.</p>\n<p>The pain usually gets worse during the first week after having a tonsillectomy, before gradually improving during the second week.&nbsp;<a>Earache</a>&nbsp;is common with tonsillectomies, but isn\'t a cause for concern.</p>\n<h2>Post-operative bleeding</h2>\n<p>Bleeding at the site where the tonsils were removed is a fairly common complication of a tonsillectomy. This can occur during the first 24 hours following surgery or up to 10 days afterwards.</p>\n<p>It\'s estimated that around 1 in 100 children and 1 in 30 adults will experience post-operative bleeding after having a tonsillectomy.</p>\n<p>Minor bleeding isn\'t usually a cause for concern, because in most cases it resolves by itself. Gargling with cold water can often help stem the bleeding, because the cold helps to contract the blood vessels.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, the bleeding can be more severe, causing people to cough up blood. Seek immediate medical advice if this happens. You should be given an emergency contact number before you\'re discharged from hospital. Alternatively, you can call NHS 24\'s&nbsp;\'111\' service.</p>\n<p>Extensive bleeding may need to be treated with surgery or a blood transfusion.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(52,51,NULL,NULL,'<h1>Vertigo:</h1>\n<h2>About vertigo</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Vertigo is a symptom, rather than a condition itself. It\'s the sensation that you, or the environment around you, is moving or spinning.</p>\n<p>This feeling may be barely noticeable, or it may be so severe that&nbsp;you find it difficult to keep your balance and do everyday tasks.</p>\n<p>Attacks of vertigo can develop suddenly and last for a few seconds, or they may last much longer. If you have severe vertigo, your symptoms may be constant and last for several days, making normal life very difficult.</p>\n<p>Other symptoms associated with vertigo may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>loss of balance &ndash; which can make it difficult to stand or walk</li>\n<li>feeling sick or being sick</li>\n<li>dizziness&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Seeking medical help</h2>\n<p>You should see your GP if you have persistent signs of vertigo or it keeps coming back.</p>\n<p>Your GP will ask about your symptoms and can carry out a simple examination to help determine&nbsp;some types of&nbsp;vertigo. They may also refer you for further tests.</p>\n<h2>What causes vertigo?</h2>\n<p>Vertigo is commonly caused by a problem with the way balance works in the inner ear, although it can also be caused by problems in certain parts of the brain.</p>\n<p>Causes of vertigo may&nbsp;include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) &ndash; where certain head movements trigger vertigo</li>\n<li><a >migraines</a>&nbsp;&ndash; severe headaches</li>\n<li><a>labyrinthitis</a>&nbsp;&ndash; an inner ear infection</li>\n<li>vestibular neuronitis &ndash; inflammation of the vestibular nerve, which runs into the inner ear and sends messages to the brain that help to control balance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending on the&nbsp;condition causing vertigo, you may experience additional symptoms, such as&nbsp;a high temperature, ringing in your ears&nbsp;(<a>tinnitus</a>) and&nbsp;<a>hearing loss</a>.</p>\n<h2>How is vertigo treated?</h2>\n<p>Some cases of vertigo improve over time, without treatment. However, some people have repeated episodes for many months, or even years, such as those with M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease.</p>\n<p>There are specific treatments for some causes of vertigo. A series of simple head movements (known as the&nbsp;Epley manoeuvre) is used to treat BPPV.</p>\n<p>Medicines, such as prochlorperazine and some antihistamines,&nbsp;can help in the early stages or most cases of vertigo.</p>\n<p>Many people with vertigo also benefit from vestibular rehabilitation training (VRT), which&nbsp;is a&nbsp;series of exercises for people with dizziness and balance problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Self care</h2>\n<p>Depending on what\'s causing your vertigo, there may be things you can do yourself to help relieve your symptoms. Your GP or the specialist treating you may advise you&nbsp;to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>do simple exercises to correct your symptoms</li>\n<li>sleep with your head slightly raised on two or more pillows</li>\n<li>get up slowly when getting out of bed and sit on the edge of the bed for a minute or so before standing</li>\n<li>avoid bending down to pick up items</li>\n<li>avoid extending your neck &ndash; for example, while reaching up to a high shelf</li>\n<li>move your head carefully and slowly during daily activities</li>\n<li>do exercises that trigger your vertigo, so your brain gets used to it and reduces the symptoms (do these only after making sure you won\'t fall, and have support if needed)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fear of heights</h2>\n<p>The term vertigo is often incorrectly used to describe a fear of heights. The medical term for a fear of heights and the dizzy feeling associated with looking down from a high place is \"acrophobia\".</p>\n<h2>Causes of vertigo</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Vertigo is a symptom of several different conditions. There are two types of vertigo, known as peripheral and central, depending on the cause.</p>\n<h2>Peripheral vertigo</h2>\n<p>Peripheral vertigo is the most common type,&nbsp;often caused by a problem with the balance mechanisms of the inner ear. The most common causes include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)</li>\n<li>head injury</li>\n<li>labyrinthitis</li>\n<li>vestibular neuronitis</li>\n<li>M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease</li>\n<li>taking&nbsp;certain types of medication</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These&nbsp;causes&nbsp;are explained in more detail below.</p>\n<h3>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)</h3>\n<p>This is one of the most common causes of vertigo.&nbsp;It can&nbsp;occur during specific head movements, while standing up or bending over, crossing the road, or turning in bed.</p>\n<p>BPPV involves short, intense, recurrent attacks of vertigo (usually lasting a few seconds to a few minutes). It is often accompanied by nausea, although vomiting is rare.&nbsp;You may&nbsp;also&nbsp;experience your eyes briefly moving&nbsp;uncontrollably (nystagmus).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Lightheadedness and a loss of balance can last for several minutes or hours after the attack.</p>\n<p>BPPV is thought to be caused by small fragments of debris (calcium carbonate crystals), which break off from the lining of the channels in your inner ear. The fragments don\'t usually cause a problem, unless they get into one of the ear\'s fluid-filled canals.</p>\n<p>When your head is still, the fragments sit at the bottom of the canal. However, certain head movements cause them to be swept along the fluid-filled canal, which sends confusing messages to your brain, causing vertigo.</p>\n<p>BPPV usually affects older people, with most cases occurring in people older than 50 years of age.</p>\n<p>BPPV may occur for no apparent reason, or it may develop after:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>an ear infection</li>\n<li>ear surgery</li>\n<li>a head injury</li>\n<li>prolonged bed rest &ndash; for example, while recovering from an illness</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Head injury</h3>\n<p>Vertigo can sometimes develop after a head injury. If you have symptoms of&nbsp;dizziness or vertigo following a head injury, seek medical attention.</p>\n<h2>Diagnosing vertigo</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Your GP will ask about your symptoms and carry out some simple tests to help them make an accurate diagnosis.</p>\n<p>In some cases, you may be referred for some further tests.</p>\n<h2>Important questions</h2>\n<p>Your GP will first want to know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>details of the first episode of your symptoms and what they were&nbsp;&ndash; for example, whether you felt lightheaded or if your surroundings were spinning</li>\n<li>if you also experience other symptoms&nbsp;&ndash; such as hearing loss, tinnitus, nausea, vomiting or fullness in the ear</li>\n<li>how often your symptoms occur and how long they last for</li>\n<li>if your symptoms are affecting your daily activities &ndash; for example, whether you\'re unable to walk during an episode of vertigo</li>\n<li>whether anything triggers your symptoms or makes them worse, such as moving your head in a particular direction</li>\n<li>what makes your symptoms better&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical examination</h2>\n<p>Your GP may also carry out a physical examination to check for signs of conditions that may be causing your vertigo. This could include looking inside your ears and checking your eyes for signs of uncontrollable movement (nystagmus).</p>\n<p>Your GP may check your balance or try to recreate your symptoms by asking you to move quickly from a sitting to a lying position.</p>\n<h2>Further tests</h2>\n<p>Depending on your symptoms, your GP&nbsp;may refer you&nbsp;to a hospital or specialist for further tests.</p>\n<h3>Hearing tests</h3>\n<p>If you have&nbsp;<a>tinnitus</a>&nbsp;(ringing in your ears) or hearing loss, your GP may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist, who can carry out&nbsp;some hearing tests.</p>\n<p>These&nbsp;may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>an audiometry test &ndash; a machine called an audiometer produces sounds of different volume and pitch. You listen to the sounds through headphones and signal when you hear a sound, either by raising your hand or pressing a button.</li>\n<li>tuning fork test &ndash; a tuning fork produces sound waves at a fixed pitch when it\'s gently tapped. The tester will tap the tuning fork before holding it at each side of your head.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Treating vertigo</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Treatment for vertigo depends on the cause and severity of your symptoms.</p>\n<p>During a vertigo attack, lying still in a quiet, darkened room may help to ease any symptoms of nausea and reduce the sensation of spinning. You may be advised to take medication.</p>\n<p>You should also try to avoid stressful situations, as anxiety can make the symptoms of vertigo worse.</p>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;what to do if you\'re&nbsp;<a >struggling with stress</a></p>\n<h2>Labyrinthitis</h2>\n<p><a>Labyrinthitis</a>&nbsp;is an inner ear infection that causes the labyrinth (a delicate structure deep inside your ear) to become inflamed. It\'s usually caused by a viral infection and clears up on its own without treatment. In rare cases, where labyrinthitis is caused by a bacterial infection,&nbsp;<a>antibiotics</a>&nbsp;may be prescribed.</p>\n<p>If you\'ve experienced any hearing loss, your GP may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist or an audiovestibular physician. This is a doctor who specialises in hearing and balance disorders. You may need emergency treatment to restore your hearing.</p>\n<p>Labyrinthitis may also be treated with vestibular rehabilitation&nbsp;&ndash; also called vestibular rehabilitation training or VRT (see below).</p>\n<p>See&nbsp;<a>treating labyrinthitis</a>&nbsp;for more information</p>\n<h2>Vestibular neuronitis</h2>\n<p>Vestibular neuronitis, also known as vestibular neuritis, is inflammation of the vestibular nerve (one of the nerves in your ear that\'s used for balance). It\'s usually caused by a viral infection.</p>\n<p>The symptoms of vestibular neuronitis&nbsp;often get better without treatment&nbsp;over several weeks. However, you may need to rest in bed if your symptoms are severe. See your GP if your symptoms get worse or don\'t start to improve after a week.</p>\n<p>You may find your balance is particularly affected if you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>drink alcohol</li>\n<li>are tired</li>\n<li>have another illness</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Avoiding these can help to improve your condition.</p>\n<p>Vestibular neuronitis can also be treated with vestibular rehabilitation and medication.</p>\n<h2>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)</h2>\n<p>Like vestibular neuronitis, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) often clears up without treatment after several weeks or months. It\'s thought that the small fragments of debris in the ear canal that cause vertigo either dissolve or become lodged in a place where they&nbsp;no longer&nbsp;cause symptoms.&nbsp;BPPV can sometimes return.</p>\n<p>Until the symptoms disappear or the condition is treated, you should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>get out of bed slowly</li>\n<li>avoid activities that involve looking upwards, such as painting and decorating or looking for something on a high shelf</li>\n</ul>\n<p>BPPV can be treated using a procedure called the Epley manoeuvre.</p>\n<h3>The Epley manoeuvre</h3>\n<p>The Epley manoeuvre involves performing four separate head movements to move the fragments that cause vertigo&nbsp;to a place where they no longer&nbsp;cause symptoms. Each head position is held for at least 30 seconds. You may experience some vertigo during the movements.</p>\n<p>Your symptoms should improve shortly after the Epley manoeuvre is performed, although it may take up to two weeks for a complete recovery. Return to your GP if your symptoms haven\'t improved after four weeks. The Epley manoeuvre isn\'t usually a long-term cure and may need to&nbsp;be repeated.</p>\n<h3>Brandt-Daroff exercises</h3>\n<p>If the Epley manoeuvre doesn\'t work, or if it\'s not suitable &ndash; for example, because you have neck or back problems&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;you can also&nbsp;try Brandt-Daroff exercises. These are a series of movements&nbsp;you can do unsupervised at home.</p>\n<p>Your GP will need to teach you how to do the exercises. You repeat them three or four times a day for two days in a row. Your symptoms may improve for up to two weeks.</p>\n<h3>Referral to a specialist</h3>\n<p>Your GP may refer you to a specialist, such as an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the Epley manoeuvre doesn\'t work or can\'t be performed</li>\n<li>you still have symptoms after four weeks</li>\n<li>you have unusual signs or symptoms</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In rare cases, where the symptoms of vertigo last for months or years, surgery may be recommended. This may involve blocking one of the fluid-filled canals in your ear. Your ENT specialist&nbsp;can give more advice on this.</p>\n<h2>M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease</h2>\n<p>If your vertigo is caused by M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease, there are a number of treatment options&nbsp;for both the vertigo and other symptoms caused by the condition.</p>\n<p>Possible treatments for M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>dietary advice&nbsp;&ndash; particularly a low-salt diet</li>\n<li>medication to treat attacks of M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease</li>\n<li>medication to prevent attacks of M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease</li>\n<li>treatment for&nbsp;<a>tinnitus</a>&nbsp;(ringing in your ears)&nbsp;&ndash; such as sound therapy,&nbsp;which works by reducing the difference between tinnitus sounds and background sounds, to make the tinnitus sounds less intrusive</li>\n<li>treatment for&nbsp;<a>hearing loss</a>&nbsp;&ndash; such as using hearing aids</li>\n<li>physiotherapy to deal with balance problems</li>\n<li>treatment for the secondary symptoms of M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease&nbsp;&ndash; such as stress, anxiety and depression</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See&nbsp;<a>treating M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease</a>&nbsp;for more information</p>\n<h2>Central vertigo</h2>\n<p>Central vertigo is caused by problems in part of your brain, such as the cerebellum (which is located at the bottom of the brain) or the brainstem (the lower part of the brain that\'s connected to the spinal cord).</p>\n<p>Causes of central vertigo include&nbsp;<a>migraines</a>&nbsp;and, less commonly,&nbsp;<a>brain tumours</a>.</p>\n<p>If your GP suspects&nbsp;you have central vertigo, they may organise a&nbsp;scan or refer you to a hospital specialist,&nbsp;such as a neurologist or an ENT (ear, nose and throat specialist) or audiovestibular physician.</p>\n<p>Treating your migraine should relieve your vertigo if it\'s caused by a migraine.</p>\n<h2>Vertigo with an unknown cause</h2>\n<p>If the cause of your vertigo is unknown, you may be admitted to hospital if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you have severe nausea and vomiting, and can\'t keep fluids down</li>\n<li>your vertigo comes on suddenly and wasn\'t caused by you changing position</li>\n<li>you possibly have central vertigo</li>\n<li>you have sudden hearing loss, but it\'s not thought to be M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Alternatively, you may be referred to a specialist, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a neurologist &ndash; a specialist in treating conditions that affect the nervous system</li>\n<li>an ENT specialist &ndash; a specialist in conditions that affect the ear, nose or throat</li>\n<li>an audiovestibular physician &ndash; a specialist in hearing and balance disorders</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While waiting to see a specialist, you may be treated with medication.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Vestibular rehabilitation</h2>\n<p>Vestibular rehabilitation, also called vestibular rehabilitation training or VRT, is a form of \"brain retraining\". It involves carrying out a special programme of exercises that encourage your brain to adapt to the abnormal messages sent from your ears.</p>\n<p>During VRT, you keep moving despite feelings of dizziness and vertigo. Your brain should eventually learn to rely on the signals coming from the rest of your body, such as your eyes and legs, rather than the confusing signals coming from your inner ear. By relying on other signals, your brain minimises any dizziness and helps you to maintain your balance.</p>\n<p>An audiologist (hearing specialist) or a physiotherapist&nbsp;may provide VRT. Your GP may be able to refer you for VRT, although it depends on availability in your&nbsp;area.</p>\n<p>In some cases,&nbsp;it&nbsp;may be possible to&nbsp;use VRT without specialist help. Research has shown that&nbsp;people with some types of vertigo can improve their symptoms using a self-help&nbsp;VRT booklet. However, you should discuss this with your doctor first.</p>\n<h2>Medicines</h2>\n<p>Medication can be used to treat&nbsp;episodes of vertigo caused by vestibular neuronitis&nbsp;or&nbsp;M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease. It may also be used for central vertigo or vertigo with an unknown cause.</p>\n<p>The medicines are usually prescribed for&nbsp;3&nbsp;to 14 days, depending on which condition they\'re for. The two medicines that are usually prescribed are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>prochlorperazine</li>\n<li>antihistamines</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If these medicines are successful in treating your symptoms, you may be given a supply to keep at home, so you can take them the next time you have an episode of vertigo.</p>\n<p>In some cases you may be advised to take long-term medication, such as betahistine, for conditions like M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease.</p>\n<h3>Prochlorperazine</h3>\n<p>Prochlorperazine can help relieve&nbsp;severe nausea and vomiting associated with vertigo. It works by blocking the effect of a chemical in the brain called dopamine.</p>\n<p>Prochlorperazine can cause side effects, including tremors (shaking) and abnormal or involuntary body and facial movements.</p>\n<p>It can also make some people feel sleepy. For the full list of possible side effects, check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine.</p>\n<h3>Antihistamines</h3>\n<p>Antihistamines can be used to help relieve less severe nausea, vomiting and vertigo symptoms. They work by blocking the effects of a&nbsp;chemical called histamine.</p>\n<p>Possible antihistamines that may be prescribed include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>cinnarizine</li>\n<li>cyclizine</li>\n<li>promethazine teoclate</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Like prochlorperazine, antihistamines can also make you feel sleepy. Headaches and an upset stomach are also possible side effects. Check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine for the full list of possible side effects.</p>\n<p>A medication called betahistine works in a similar way to antihistamines. It has been used to treat M&eacute;ni&egrave;re\'s disease and may also be used for other balance problems. It may have to be taken for a long period of time. The beneficial effects vary from person to person.</p>\n<h3>Safety</h3>\n<p>If you have vertigo, there are some safety issues&nbsp;to consider. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you should inform your employer if your job involves operating machinery or climbing ladders</li>\n<li>you may be at increased risk of falls &ndash; see&nbsp;<a>preventing falls</a>&nbsp;for advice&nbsp;on making your home safer and reducing your risk</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Vertigo could also affect your ability to drive. You should avoid driving if you\'ve recently had episodes of vertigo and there\'s a chance you may have another episode while you\'re driving.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(53,52,NULL,NULL,'<h1>Chest infection:</h1>\n<h2 >Signs and symptoms of a chest infection</h2>\n<p>The main symptoms of a chest infection can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a persistent&nbsp;<a >cough</a></li>\n<li>coughing up yellow or green phlegm (thick mucus), or coughing up blood</li>\n<li><a >breathlessness</a>&nbsp;or rapid and shallow breathing</li>\n<li>wheezing</li>\n<li>a high temperature (fever)</li>\n<li>a rapid heartbeat</li>\n<li>chest pain or tightness</li>\n<li>feeling confused and disorientated</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 >What causes chest infections?</h2>\n<p>A chest infection is an infection of the lungs or airways. The main types of chest infection are&nbsp;<a>bronchitis</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a>pneumonia</a>.</p>\n<p>Most bronchitis cases are caused by viruses, whereas most pneumonia cases are due to bacteria.</p>\n<p>These infections are usually spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes. This launches tiny droplets of fluid containing the virus or bacteria into the air, where they can be breathed in by others.</p>\n<p>The infections can also be spread to others if you cough or sneeze onto your hand, an object or a surface, and someone else shakes your hand or touches those surfaces before touching their mouth or nose.</p>\n<p>Certain groups of people have a higher risk of developing serious chest infections, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>babies and very young children</li>\n<li>children with developmental problems</li>\n<li>people who are very overweight</li>\n<li>elderly people</li>\n<li>pregnant women</li>\n<li>people who smoke</li>\n<li>people with long-term health conditions, such as&nbsp;<a>asthma</a>,&nbsp;<a >heart disease</a>,&nbsp;<a>diabetes</a>,&nbsp;<a >kidney disease</a>,&nbsp;<a >cystic fibrosis</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</a></li>\n<li>people with a weakened immune system &ndash; this could be due to a recent illness, a transplant, high-dose steroids,&nbsp;<a>chemotherapy</a>&nbsp;or a health condition, such as an undiagnosed&nbsp;<a>HIV</a>&nbsp;infection</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"treatment\">Caring for your symptoms at home</h2>\n<p>Many chest infections aren\'t serious and get better within a few days or weeks.

Smoking damages your lungs and weakens your defences against infection.</p>\n<h3>Good hygiene</h3>\n<p>Although chest infections generally aren\'t as contagious as other common infections, like flu, you can pass them on to others through coughing and sneezing.</p>\n<p>Therefore, it\'s important to cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze, and to wash your hands regularly. Put tissues in the bin immediately.</p>\n<h3>Alcohol and diet</h3>\n<p>Excessive and prolonged&nbsp;<a>alcohol misuse</a>&nbsp;can weaken your lungs\' natural defences against infections and make you more vulnerable to chest infections.</p>\n<p>To keep your risk of alcohol-related harm low, the NHS recommends:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>not regularly drinking more than 14 units of alcohol a week</li>\n<li>if you drink as much as 14 units a week, it\'s best to spread this evenly over three or more days</li>\n<li>if you\'re trying to reduce the amount of alcohol you drink, it\'s a good idea to have several alcohol-free days each week</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Regular or frequent drinking means drinking alcohol most weeks. The risk to your health is increased by drinking any amount of alcohol on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>Eating a healthy, balanced diet can help strengthen the immune system, making you less vulnerable to developing chest infections.</p>\n<h3>Vaccinations</h3>\n<p>If you\'re at an increased risk of chest infections, your GP may recommend being vaccinated against flu and pneumococcal infections (a bacterium that can cause pneumonia).</p>\n<p>These vaccinations should help to reduce your chances of getting chest infections in the future.</p>\n<p>Flu and pneumococcal vaccinations are usually recommended for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>babies and young children</li>\n<li>pregnant women (flu jab only)</li>\n<li>people aged 65 and over</li>\n<li>people with long-term health conditions or weakened immune systems</li>\n</ul>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(54,53,NULL,NULL,'<h1>Chickenpox:</h1>\n<h2>Symptoms of chickenpox</h2>\n<div>\n<p>The most commonly recognised chickenpox symptom is a spotty, blistering red rash that can cover the entire body.</p>\n<h2>Chickenpox spots</h2>\n<p>The&nbsp;spots normally appear in clusters and tend to be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>behind the ears</li>\n<li>on the face</li>\n<li>over the scalp</li>\n<li>on the chest and belly</li>\n<li>on the arms and legs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, the spots can be anywhere on the body, even inside the ears and mouth, on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet and inside the nappy area.</p>\n<p>Although the&nbsp;rash starts as small, itchy red spots, these develop a&nbsp;<a>blister</a>&nbsp;on top and become&nbsp;intensely itchy after about 12-14 hours.</p>\n<p>After a day or two, the fluid in the blisters gets cloudy and they begin to dry out and crust over.</p>\n<p>After 1&nbsp;to 2&nbsp;weeks, the crusting skin will fall off naturally.</p>\n<p>New spots&nbsp;can keep appearing in waves for 3&nbsp;to 5&nbsp;days after the rash begins.

You catch it by coming into contact with someone who is infected.</p>\n<p>Chickenpox is a very contagious infection. Around 90% of people who have not previously had chickenpox will become infected when they come into contact with the virus.</p>\n<h2>How you catch&nbsp;the virus</h2>\n<p>The chickenpox virus is spread most easily from someone who has the rash. The blisters are very itchy and break open easily,&nbsp;which can contaminate surfaces or objects. The virus may then be transferred by touching the surface or object, then touching your face.</p>\n<p>The virus is also&nbsp;contained in the millions of tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth&nbsp;when an infected person coughs or sneezes. This can also contaminate surfaces or objects.</p>\n<p>It normally takes&nbsp;14 days for the&nbsp;<a>symptoms of chickenpox</a>&nbsp;to show after you have come into contact with the virus. However, this can vary from person to person &ndash; from as little as 7 days, up to 21 days.&nbsp;This is called the \"incubation period\".</p>\n<p>Someone&nbsp;with chickenpox is most infectious from 1&nbsp;to 2&nbsp;days before the rash appears, until all the blisters have crusted over. This usually takes 5&nbsp;to 6&nbsp;days&nbsp;from the start of the rash.</p>\n<p>Read more about the&nbsp;<a>diagnosis of chickenpox</a>&nbsp;and how to&nbsp;<a>stop chickenpox spreading</a>.</p>\n<h2>Shingles</h2>\n<p>If you have not had chickenpox before,&nbsp;you can also&nbsp;catch chickenpox from someone&nbsp;with shingles (an infection caused by the same virus). However, it\'s not possible to catch shingles from someone who has chickenpox.</p>\n<h2>Diagnosing chickenpox</h2>\n<div class=\"editor\">\n<p>You or your child should not usually need any medical tests to diagnose chickenpox. You can be pretty sure that it is chickenpox if there are the key symptoms of a mild fever followed by an itchy rash, with blisters and scabs.</p>\n<p>Chickenpox&nbsp;spots are&nbsp;usually&nbsp;distinctive enough&nbsp;to distinguish from other rashes, although they can be confused with other conditions that affect the skin, such as&nbsp;<a>insect bites</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>scabies</a>&nbsp;(another contagious skin condition that causes intense itching).</p>\n<p>If&nbsp;you\'re uncertain&nbsp;about what is causing the symptoms, your GP can carry out a simple blood test to identify the virus.</p>\n<p><a >Find your local GP surgery</a>.</p>\n<h2>When to contact your GP</h2>\n<p>1. See your GP if you\'re not sure whether you or your child have chickenpox.</p>\n<p>2. Contact your GP&nbsp;urgently if you have been in contact with someone who has chickenpox, or you have chickenpox symptoms and:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you are pregnant</li>\n<li>you have a weakened immune system (the body&rsquo;s defence system)</li>\n<li>your baby is less than 4&nbsp;weeks old</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chickenpox in these&nbsp;instances can cause serious complications, if left untreated. It is essential to seek medical advice so that you can receive any necessary treatment.</p>\n<p>3.&nbsp;Contact your GP if you have chickenpox and are breastfeeding. They can advise about whether you should continue breastfeeding your baby.</p>\n<h2>Having a blood test</h2>\n<p>Once you have contacted your GP,&nbsp;you&nbsp;may need&nbsp;a test&nbsp;to see if you\'re already&nbsp;immune from chickenpox.</p>\n<p>If you have had chickenpox in the past, it is extremely unlikely that you will develop chickenpox for a second time. If you\'ve never had chickenpox, or you\'re unsure whether you\'ve had it, you may need an immunity&nbsp;test.</p>\n<p>This is a&nbsp;<a>blood test</a>&nbsp;that checks whether you are producing the antibodies to the chickenpox virus.</p>\n<p>If your blood test result shows that you have the antibodies, you\'ll be naturally protected from the virus. If you don\'t have the antibodies, you\'ll need to be monitored closely to see if you develop&nbsp;<a >chickenpox symptoms</a>. If&nbsp;you do, further treatment may be needed.</p>\n<h2>Treating chickenpox</h2>\n<div >\n<p>There is no cure for chickenpox, and the virus usually clears up by itself without any treatment.</p>\n<p>However, there are ways of easing the itch and discomfort, and there are important steps you can take to&nbsp;<a>stop chickenpox spreading</a>.</p>\n<h2>Painkillers</h2>\n<p>If your child is in pain or has a high temperature (fever), you can give them a mild painkiller, such as&nbsp;<a>paracetamol</a>&nbsp;(available over the counter in pharmacies). Always read the manufacturer\'s dosage instructions.</p>\n<p>Paracetamol is the preferred painkiller for treating the associated symptoms of chickenpox. This is due to a very small risk of&nbsp;<a >non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</a>, such as&nbsp;<a>ibuprofen</a>, causing adverse skin reactions during chickenpox.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Avoid giving your child ibuprofen if they have&nbsp;<a>asthma</a>&nbsp;or a history of stomach problems. If you\'re not sure whether ibuprofen&nbsp;is suitable, check with your GP or pharmacist. If your child is younger than 3&nbsp;months old, you should always speak to your GP before giving your child any kind of pain relief.</p>\n<p>Never&nbsp;give your child aspirin if you suspect or know&nbsp;that they have chickenpox.</p>\n<p>If you\'re pregnant and need to take painkillers, then paracetamol is the first choice. You can use it&nbsp;at any stage of pregnancy. Only take ibuprofen&nbsp;during the second trimester (weeks 14-27 of the pregnancy).</p>\n<p>If you\'re pregnant and have chickenpox, you should visit your GP as soon as possible. You may need to have antiviral medicine or immunoglobulin treatment to prevent your symptoms&nbsp;from getting worse.</p>\n<h2>Keeping hydrated</h2>\n<p>It is important&nbsp;for children (and adults) with chickenpox&nbsp;to drink plenty of water to avoid&nbsp;<a>dehydration</a>. Sugar-free ice lollies&nbsp;are a good way of getting fluids into children. They also help to soothe a sore mouth that has chickenpox spots in it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Avoid anything that may make the&nbsp;mouth sore, such as salty foods. Soup is easy to swallow as long as it is not too hot.</p>\n<h2>Stop the scratching</h2>\n<p>Chickenpox can be incredibly itchy, but it\'s important&nbsp;for children (and adults)&nbsp;to not scratch the spots, to avoid future scarring.</p>\n<p>One&nbsp;way of stopping scratching is to keep fingernails clean and short. You can also&nbsp;put socks over your child\'s hands at night to stop them scratching the rash as they sleep.</p>\n<p>If your child\'s skin is very itchy or sore, try using calamine lotion or cooling gels.&nbsp;These are&nbsp;available in pharmacies and are&nbsp;very safe to use. They have a soothing, cooling effect.</p>\n<p>A stronger medicine called chlorphenamine&nbsp;can also help&nbsp;to relieve the itching.&nbsp;It\'s available from your pharmacist over the counter or it can be&nbsp;prescribed by your GP.&nbsp;Chlorphenamine is&nbsp;taken by mouth and is suitable for children over 1&nbsp;year old.</p>\n<h2>Cool clothing</h2>\n<p>If your child has a fever, or if their skin is sore and aggravated, dress them appropriately so that they don\'t get too hot or too cold. Loose-fitting, smooth, cotton fabrics are best and&nbsp;will help stop the skin from becoming sore and irritated.</p>\n<p>If your child has chickenpox, avoid sponging them down with cool water. This can make your child too cold and may make them shiver.</p>\n<h2>Stronger treatments</h2>\n<h3>Antiviral medicine</h3>\n<p>Aciclovir is an antiviral medicine that is sometimes given to people with chickenpox.</p>\n<p>Aciclovir may be prescribed to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>pregnant women</li>\n<li>adults, if they visit their GP within 24 hours of the rash appearing</li>\n<li>newborn babies</li>\n<li>people with a weakened immune system (the body&rsquo;s defence system)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ideally, aciclovir needs to be started within 24 hours of&nbsp;the rash appearing. It does not cure chickenpox, but it makes the symptoms less severe. You&nbsp;normally need to take the medicine as tablets 5&nbsp;times a day for 7&nbsp;days.</p>\n<p>If you are taking aciclovir, make sure you drink plenty of fluids. Side effects are rare, but can include nausea and&nbsp;<a>diarrhoea</a>.</p>\n<h3>Immunoglobulin treatment</h3>\n<p>Immunoglobulin is a solution of antibodies that is taken from healthy donors. Varicella-zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) contains antibodies to the chickenpox virus.</p>\n<p>Immunoglobulin treatment is given by injection. It is not used to treat chickenpox, but to protect people who are at high risk&nbsp;of developing a severe chickenpox infection. This includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>pregnant women</li>\n<li>newborn babies</li>\n<li>people with weakened immune systems</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the case of pregnant women, immunoglobulin treatment also reduces the risk of the unborn baby becoming infected.</p>\n<p>As the supply of VZIG is limited, it will only be considered if a high-risk person has:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>been significantly exposed to the virus &ndash; significant exposure could be face-to-face contact with someone who has chickenpox</li>\n<li>been in the same room for 15 minutes with someone who has chickenpox</li>\n<li>had a blood test to confirm that&nbsp;they\'ve not had chickenpox before</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In some cases, newborn babies may be given immunoglobulin treatment without having a blood test first.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(55,54,NULL,NULL,'<h1>Food poisoning:</h1>\n<h2>Causes of food poisoning</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Food can become contaminated at any stage during its production, processing or cooking.</p>\n<p>For example,&nbsp;it can become contaminated by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>not cooking food thoroughly (particularly meat)</li>\n<li>not&nbsp;correctly storing food that needs to be chilled at below 5C</li>\n<li>keeping cooked food unrefrigerated for a long period</li>\n<li>eating food that has been touched by someone who is ill or has been in contact with someone with&nbsp;<a>diarrhoea</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a>vomiting</a></li>\n<li>cross-contamination (where harmful bacteria are spread between food, surfaces and equipment)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cross-contamination can occur, for example, if you prepare raw chicken on a chopping board and don\'t wash the board before preparing food that won\'t be cooked (such as salad), as the harmful bacteria can be spread from the chopping board to the salad.</p>\n<p>It&nbsp;can also occur if raw meat is stored above ready-to-eat meals and juices from the meat drip on to the food below.</p>\n<p>See&nbsp;<a>preventing food poisoning</a>&nbsp;for information about reducing these risks</p>\n<h2>Types of infection</h2>\n<p>Food contamination is usually caused by bacteria, but it can also sometimes be caused by viruses or parasites. Some of the main sources of contamination are described below.</p>\n<h3>Campylobacter</h3>\n<p>In the UK, campylobacter bacteria are the most common cause of food poisoning. The bacteria are usually found on raw or undercooked meat (particularly poultry), unpasteurised milk and untreated water.</p>\n<p>The incubation period (the time between eating contaminated food and the start of symptoms) for food poisoning caused by campylobacter is usually between two and five days. The symptoms usually last less than a week.</p>\n<h3>Salmonella</h3>\n<p>Salmonella bacteria are often found in raw or undercooked meat, raw eggs, milk, and other dairy products.</p>\n<p>The incubation period is usually between 12 and 72 hours. The symptoms usually last around four to seven days.</p>\n<h3>Listeria</h3>\n<p>Listeria bacteria may be found in a range of chilled, \"ready-to-eat\" foods, including pre-packed sandwiches, cooked sliced meats and p&acirc;t&eacute;, and soft cheeses (such as Brie or Camembert).</p>\n<p>All of these foods should be eaten by their \"use-by\" dates. This is particularly important for pregnant women, because a listeria infection (known as listeriosis) in pregnancy can cause pregnancy and birth complications, and can result in&nbsp;<a>miscarriage</a>.</p>\n<p>The incubation period can vary considerably, from a few days to several weeks. The symptoms will usually pass within three days.</p>\n<h3>Escherichia coli (E. coli)</h3>\n<p>Escherichia coli, often known as E. coli, are bacteria found in the digestive systems of many animals, including humans. Most strains are harmless but some can cause serious illness.</p>\n<p>Most cases of E. coli food poisoning occur after eating undercooked beef (particularly mince, burgers and meatballs) or drinking unpasteurised milk.</p>\n<p>The incubation period for food poisoning caused by E. coli is typically one to eight days. The symptoms usually last for a few days or weeks.</p>\n<h3>Shigella</h3>\n<p>Shigella bacteria can&nbsp;contaminate any food that has been washed in contaminated water.</p>\n<p>Symptoms typically develop within seven days of eating contaminated food and last for up to a week.</p>\n<p>An infection caused by Shigella bacteria is known as bacillary dysentery or shigellosis. See the topic on dysentery for more information about it.</p>\n<h3>Viruses</h3>\n<p>The virus that most commonly causes diarrhoea and vomiting is the&nbsp;<a>norovirus</a>. It\'s easily spread from person to person, through contaminated food or water. Raw shellfish, particularly oysters, can also be a source of infection.</p>\n<p>The incubation period typically lasts 24-48 hours and the symptoms usually pass in a couple of days.</p>\n<p>In young children, the rotavirus is a common cause of infection from contaminated food. The symptoms usually develop within a week and pass in around five to seven days.</p>\n<h3>Parasites</h3>\n<p>In the UK, food poisoning&nbsp;caused by parasites is rare. It\'s much more common in the developing world.</p>\n<p>Parasitic infections that can be spread in contaminated food include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>giardiasis &ndash; an infection caused by a parasite called Giardia intestinalis</li>\n<li>cryptosporidiosis &ndash; an infection caused by a parasite called Cryptosporidium</li>\n<li>ameobiasis &ndash; a type of dysentery caused by a single-cell parasite (ameoba) called Entamoeba histolytica (this is very rare in the UK)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The symptoms of food poisoning caused by a parasite usually develop within 10 days of eating contaminated food, although sometimes it may be weeks before you feel unwell.</p>\n<p>If left untreated, the symptoms can last a long time &ndash; sometimes several weeks or even a few months.</p>\n<h2>Treating food poisoning</h2>\n<div class=\"editor\">\n<p>Food poisoning can usually be treated at home without seeking medical advice. Most people will feel better within a few days.</p>\n<p>It\'s important to avoid&nbsp;<a>dehydration</a>&nbsp;by drinking plenty of water, even if you can only sip it,&nbsp;as you need to replace any&nbsp;fluids&nbsp;lost through vomiting and&nbsp;<a>diarrhoea</a>.</p>\n<p>You should also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>rest as much as possible</li>\n<li>eat when you feel up to it&nbsp;&ndash; sticking to small, light and non-fatty meals at first (bland foods such as&nbsp;toast, crackers, rice and bananas are good choices)</li>\n<li>avoid alcohol, caffeine, fizzy drinks&nbsp;and spicy and fatty foods because they may make you feel worse</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Contact&nbsp;your GP if your symptoms are severe or don\'t start to improve in a few days.</p>\n<h2>Preventing the spread of infection</h2>\n<p>If you have food poisoning, you shouldn\'t prepare food for other people and you should try to keep contact with vulnerable people, such as the elderly or very young, to a minimum.</p>\n<p>Stay off work or school until at least 48 hours after the last episode of diarrhoea.</p>\n<p>If someone you live with has food poisoning, you&nbsp;should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>make sure everyone in your household (including yourself) washes their hands with soap and warm water regularly &ndash; particularly after going to the toilet and before and after preparing food</li>\n<li>clean surfaces,&nbsp;toilet seats, flush handles, basins and taps frequently</li>\n<li>make sure everyone has their own towels and flannels</li>\n<li>wash the laundry of&nbsp;the infected person on the hottest washing machine setting</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Oral rehydration&nbsp;solution (ORS)</h2>\n<p>Oral rehydration solutions (ORS) are recommended for people vulnerable to the effects of dehydration, such as the elderly and those with a pre-existing health condition.</p>\n<p>ORSs are available in sachets from pharmacies. You dissolve them in water to drink and they help replace salt, glucose and other important minerals your body loses through dehydration.</p>\n<p>If you have a kidney condition, some types of oral rehydration salts may not be suitable for you. Ask your pharmacist or GP for further advice about this.</p>\n<h2>Further treatment</h2>\n<p>If your symptoms are severe or persistent, or you are more vulnerable to serious infection (for example, because you are elderly or have an underlying health condition), you may need further treatment.</p>\n<p>Tests may be carried out on a stool sample to find out what it causing your symptoms and&nbsp;<a>antibiotics</a>&nbsp;may be prescribed if the results show you have a bacterial infection.</p>\n<p>Medication to stop you vomiting (anti-emetics) may also be prescribed if your vomiting is particularly severe.</p>\n<p>In some cases, you may need to be admitted to hospital for a few days so you can be monitored and given fluids directly into a vein (intravenously).</p>\n</div>\n</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(56,55,NULL,NULL,'<h1>Glandular fever:</h1>\n<h2>Symptoms of glandular fever</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Symptoms of glandular fever are thought to take around one to two months to develop after infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).</p>\n<h2>Main symptoms</h2>\n<p>The&nbsp;most common&nbsp;symptoms of the condition are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a high temperature (fever)</li>\n<li>a&nbsp;<a>sore throat</a>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;this is usually more painful than any you may have had before</li>\n<li><a>swollen glands</a>&nbsp;in your neck and possibly in other parts of your body, such as under your armpits</li>\n<li>fatigue (extreme tiredness)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Other symptoms</h2>\n<p>Glandular fever can also cause:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a general sense of feeling unwell</li>\n<li>aching muscles</li>\n<li>chills</li>\n<li>sweats</li>\n<li>loss of appetite</li>\n<li>pain around or behind your eyes</li>\n<li>swollen tonsils and adenoids (small lumps of tissue at the back of the nose), which may affect your breathing</li>\n<li>the inside of your throat to become very red and ooze fluid</li>\n<li>small red or purple spots on the roof of your mouth</li>\n<li>a rash</li>\n<li>swelling or \"puffiness\" around your eyes</li>\n<li>a tender or swollen tummy</li>\n<li>jaundice&nbsp;(yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of these symptoms may develop a few days before the main symptoms&nbsp;mentioned above.</p>\n<h2>How the condition progresses</h2>\n<p>Most symptoms of glandular fever will&nbsp;usually resolve within two or three weeks.&nbsp;Your throat will normally feel most&nbsp;sore&nbsp;for three to five days after symptoms start before gradually improving, and your fever will usually last 10 to 14 days.</p>\n<p>Fatigue is the most persistent symptom and&nbsp;often lasts a few weeks, although some people may feel persistently fatigued for several months after the other symptoms have passed.</p>\n<h2>When to seek medical advice</h2>\n<p>You should contact your GP if you suspect that you or your child has glandular fever.</p>\n<p>While there is little your GP can do in terms of treatment other than provide advice and support,&nbsp;<a>blood tests</a>&nbsp;may be needed to rule out less common but more serious causes of your symptoms, such as hepatitis&nbsp;(a viral infection that affects the liver).</p>\n<p>You should go to your local accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department&nbsp;or dial 999 for an ambulance&nbsp;if you have glandular fever and you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>develop a rasping breath (stridor) or have any breathing difficulties</li>\n<li>find swallowing fluids difficult</li>\n<li>develop&nbsp;intense abdominal pain</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have these symptoms, you may need to be looked after in hospital for a few days.</p>\n<h2>Causes of glandular fever</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Glandular fever is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV is most often spread through the saliva of someone who carries the infection.</p>\n<p>For example, it can be spread through:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>kissing&nbsp;&ndash; glandular fever is sometimes referred to as the \"kissing disease\"</li>\n<li>sharing food and drinks</li>\n<li>sharing toothbrushes</li>\n<li>exposure to coughs and sneezes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Small children may be infected by chewing toys that have been contaminated with the virus.</p>\n<p>When you come into contact with infected saliva, the virus can infect the cells on the lining of your throat.</p>\n<p>The infection is then passed into your white blood cells before spreading through the lymphatic system.</p>\n<p>This is a series of glands (nodes) found throughout your body that allows many of the cells that your immune system needs to travel around the body.</p>\n<p>After the infection has passed, people develop lifelong immunity to the virus and most won\'t develop symptoms again.</p>\n<p>Many people are first exposed to EBV during childhood, when the infection causes few symptoms and often goes unrecognised before it eventually passes.</p>\n<p>Young adults may be most at risk of glandular fever because they might not have been exposed to the virus when they were younger, and the infection tends to produce more severe symptoms when you\'re older.</p>\n<h2>EBV carriers</h2>\n<p>Not everyone who can pass on EBV will have symptoms themselves. These are known as asymptomatic carriers.</p>\n<p>Some people can have the virus in their saliva for a few months after recovering from glandular fever, and may continue to have the virus in their saliva on and off for years.</p>\n<p>This is because the virus remains inactive in the body for the rest of your life after you have been exposed to it. For most people, the inactive virus won\'t cause any symptoms.</p>\n<p>However, there is a chance of the virus periodically becoming reactivated, which may mean it re-enters the saliva. This reactivation may be without any symptoms, or it&nbsp;may cause symptoms to recur for a short time.</p>\n<h2>Treating glandular fever</h2>\n<div class=\"editor\">\n<p>There is currently no cure for glandular fever, but the symptoms should pass within a few weeks.

This is because you may have a swollen spleen that&nbsp;it is more vulnerable to damage, and a sudden knock could cause it to burst (rupture).</p>\n<h2>Preventing the spread of infection</h2>\n<p>There is no need to be isolated from others if you have glandular fever&nbsp;as most people will already be immune to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).</p>\n<p>You can return to work, college or school as soon as you feel well enough. There is little risk of spreading the infection to others as long as you follow commonsense precautions while you are ill, such as not kissing other people or sharing utensils.</p>\n<p>It is also important to&nbsp;thoroughly clean anything that may have been contaminated by saliva until you have recovered.</p>\n<h2>Antibiotics and steroids</h2>\n<p><a>Antibiotics</a>&nbsp;are not effective in treating glandular fever because they have no effect on viruses,&nbsp;but they&nbsp;may be prescribed if you also develop a bacterial infection of&nbsp;your throat or lungs&nbsp;<a >(pneumonia)</a>.</p>\n<p>A short course of&nbsp;<a>corticosteroids</a>&nbsp;may also be helpful if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>your tonsils are particularly swollen&nbsp;and&nbsp;are causing breathing difficulties</li>\n<li>you have severe anaemia (a lack of oxygen-carrying red blood cells)</li>\n<li>you have&nbsp;problems affecting your heart, such as pericarditis (inflammation of the sac that surrounds the heart)</li>\n<li>you have&nbsp;problems affecting your brain or nerves, such as encephalitis</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a>complications of glandular fever</a>.</p>\n<h2>Hospital treatment</h2>\n<p>Most people are able to recover from glandular fever&nbsp;at home, but hospital treatment may be necessary for a few days if you or your child:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>develop a rasping breath (stridor) or have any breathing difficulties</li>\n<li>find swallowing fluids difficult</li>\n<li>develop intense abdominal pain</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Treatment in hospital may involve receiving fluids or antibiotics directly into a vein (intravenously), corticosteroid injections and pain relief.</p>\n<p>In&nbsp;a small number of&nbsp;cases, emergency surgery to remove&nbsp;the spleen (splenectomy) may be needed if it ruptures.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(57,56,NULL,NULL,'<h1>Hand, foot and mouth disease:</h1>\n<h2>About hand, foot and mouth disease</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Hand, foot and mouth disease is a common infection that causes mouth ulcers and spots on the hands and feet.</p>\n<p>It\'s most common in young children&nbsp;&ndash; particularly those under&nbsp;10 &ndash; but can affect older children and adults as well.</p>\n<p>Hand, foot and mouth disease can be unpleasant, but it will usually clear up by itself within 7 to 10 days.

The average incubation period is around 17 days.</p>\n<p>Swelling of the parotid glands is the most common symptom of mumps. The parotid glands are a pair of glands responsible for producing saliva. They\'re located in either side of your face, just below your ears.</p>\n<p>Both glands are usually affected by the swelling, although only one gland can be affected. The swelling can cause pain, tenderness and&nbsp;difficulty with swallowing.</p>\n<p>More general symptoms often develop a few days before the parotid glands swell.

These viruses are a common source of infection, particularly in children.</p>\n<p>When you get mumps, the virus moves from your respiratory tract (your nose, mouth and throat) into your parotid glands (saliva-producing glands found either side of your face), where it begins to reproduce. This causes the glands to swell.</p>\n<p>The virus can also enter your cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is the fluid that surrounds and protects your brain and spine. Once the virus has entered the CSF, it can spread to other parts of your body, such as your brain, pancreas, testicles (in boys and men) and ovaries (in girls and women).</p>\n<h2>How mumps is spread</h2>\n<p>Mumps is an airborne virus and can be spread by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>an infected person coughing or sneezing and releasing tiny droplets of contaminated saliva, which can then be breathed in by another person</li>\n<li>an infected person touching their nose or mouth, then transferring the virus onto an object, such as a door handle, or work surface; if someone else touches the object shortly afterwards, they can transfer the virus into their respiratory tract</li>\n<li>sharing utensils, such as cups, cutlery or plates with an infected person</li>\n</ul>\n<p>People with mumps are usually most infectious&nbsp;from a few days before their parotid glands swell until a few days afterwards. For this reason, it\'s advisable to avoid work or school for five days after your symptoms&nbsp;first develop&nbsp;if you\'re diagnosed with mumps.</p>\n<p>Mumps&nbsp;can also be passed on by people who are infected with&nbsp;the virus&nbsp;but don\'t have any obvious symptoms.</p>\n<h2>Diagnosing mumps</h2>\n<div>\n<p>If you suspect that you or your child has mumps, it\'s important to&nbsp;see your GP&nbsp;for a diagnosis.</p>\n<p>Let your GP know in advance of your surgery visit so&nbsp;any necessary precautions to prevent the spread of infection can be taken.</p>\n<p>Mumps&nbsp;can usually be&nbsp;diagnosed from the symptoms, in particular&nbsp;the swelling of&nbsp;glands in the sides of your face (parotid glands).</p>\n<p>If you have mumps, your GP can see and feel the swelling. By looking inside your mouth, they may be able to see that your tonsils have been pushed out of their usual position.</p>\n<p>Your GP can also check your temperature to see if it is higher than normal.</p>\n<p>If your GP suspects mumps, they should notify&nbsp;your local health protection unit (HPU). The HPU will arrange for a sample of your saliva to be tested to confirm&nbsp;or rule out&nbsp;the diagnosis.</p>\n<h2>Treating mumps</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Treatment for mumps is focused on relieving symptoms until your body&rsquo;s immune system fights off the infection.

This can be through:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>direct contact &ndash; for example, when someone coughs or sneezes, tiny droplets of fluid that contain the bacteria are launched into the air and can be breathed in by others</li>\n<li>indirect contact &ndash; for example, if infected droplets of fluid are transferred from someone\'s hand to a door handle, someone else who touches the handle may become infected with the bacteria if they then touch their nose or mouth</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It\'s important to emphasise that pneumococcal infections are far less contagious than a cold or flu. This is because most people\'s immune systems are able to kill the bacteria before they have the opportunity to cause an infection.</p>\n<p>Outbreaks of pneumococcal infections can sometimes occur in environments where there are many people who have poorly functioning immune systems, such as in children\'s nurseries, care homes for the elderly and homeless shelters.</p>\n<h2>Risk factors</h2>\n<p>People with a weakened immune system, either due to their age or general health, are particularly at risk of developing a pneumococcal infection.</p>\n<p>The bacteria can move from their throat to other parts of their body, such as the lungs, the blood or the brain.

The fluids produced during an invasive pneumococcal infection often cause a distinctive crackling sound.</p>\n<h2>Blood test</h2>\n<p>You may have a&nbsp;<a>blood test</a>&nbsp;to check for the presence of bacteria. A high number of infection-fighting white blood cells may indicate the presence of an infection. The blood sample can be sent to a laboratory so the bacteria that caused the infection can be identified.</p>\n<h2>Radiography</h2>\n<p>Several different types of imaging tests may be used, depending on your symptoms.</p>\n<p><a>X-rays</a>&nbsp;may be able to highlight the presence of fluid in the lungs, which would indicate a lung infection. An X-ray uses radiation to produce images of the inside of the body.</p>\n<p>Other imaging tests that may be used to investigate a potential pneumococcal infection include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a&nbsp;<a>computerised tomography (CT) scan</a></li>\n<li>a&nbsp;<a>magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Blood pressure test</h2>\n<p>Your blood pressure may be measured, as a serious infection can often lead to a decrease in blood pressure.</p>\n<h2>Lumbar puncture test</h2>\n<p>A lumbar puncture test involves taking a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid that surrounds the brain and spine) from the base of your spine and checking it for the presence of bacteria. A local anaesthetic will be used to numb the area. If the sample contains infection-fighting white blood cells and/or bacteria, it may indicate that you have&nbsp;<a>meningitis</a>.</p>\n<h2>Urinary antigen test</h2>\n<p>A urinary antigen test is a relatively new type of test used to help diagnose a pneumococcal infection.</p>\n<p>It involves taking a urine sample, then carrying out a technique known as an immunochromatographic assay. This can detect the distinctive protein molecules that make up the outer shell of the S. pneumoniae bacteria.</p>\n<h2>Treating pneumococcal infections</h2>\n<div >\n<p>The treatment you receive depends on whether you have an invasive or non-invasive pneumococcal infection. Antibiotics are often used to treat a serious infection.</p>\n<h2>Non-invasive pneumococcal infections</h2>\n<p>Non-invasive pneumococcal infections, such as sinusitis or bronchitis, will usually clear up within a week without the need for treatment.</p>\n<p>Drinking plenty of fluids, getting plenty of rest and taking over-the-counter painkillers, such as&nbsp;<a>paracetamol</a>, should help relieve your symptoms.</p>\n<p>Read more information about treating specific types of pneumococcal infection:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a>treating bronchitis</a></li>\n<li><a >treating middle ear infection (otitis media)</a></li>\n<li><a>treating sinusitis</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Invasive pneumococcal infections</h2>\n<p>If you have an invasive pneumococcal infection, such as&nbsp;<a>pneumonia</a>, a decision will be made about whether you are well enough to be treated at home or need to be admitted to hospital.</p>\n<p>Most GPs use a scoring system, known as the CRB-65 score, to assess the potential seriousness of a case of pneumonia.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>C stands for confusion &ndash; if you are mentally confused, you may have a more serious infection.</li>\n<li>R stands for respiratory rate &ndash; your respiratory rate is how many breaths you take in a minute.

Depending on the results of the assessment, you may be treated at home or be admitted to hospital.</li>\n<li>A CRB-65 score of 3 or more means you have a high risk of developing complications and you should be admitted to hospital for urgent treatment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hospital admission is also recommended for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>any type of invasive pneumococcal infection that has developed in a baby or child younger than two years of age</li>\n<li>all cases of suspected&nbsp;<a>meningitis</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Treatment at home</h4>\n<p>If you are being treated at home, you will usually be prescribed a seven-day course of&nbsp;<a>antibiotics</a>&nbsp;and asked to get plenty of rest and fluids.</p>\n<p>It\'s very important to finish your course of antibiotics, even if you start to feel better. Not completing the full course of antibiotics could cause the pneumonia to return.</p>\n<h4>Treatment at hospital</h4>\n<p>If your symptoms are moderate, you can usually be treated with antibiotic tablets.</p>\n<p>If your symptoms are severe, you will usually be given antibiotics through a drip into your arm. You may also be given fluids to stop you becoming dehydrated, and oxygen to help you breathe.</p>\n<p>Depending on how well you respond to treatment, it may be possible to switch from a drip to antibiotic tablets after a few days.</p>\n<p>Most people who are treated in hospital require a 7-10 day course of antibiotics. The time it will take before you are well enough to return home will depend on your general state of health and whether you experience a more serious type of pneumococcal infection, such as meningitis.</p>\n<h4>Follow-up</h4>\n<p>It\'s usually recommended that you attend a follow-up examination six weeks after the start of your symptoms. This is to check that the infection has not caused any serious or permanent damage to the affected parts of your body, such as your lungs.</p>\n<p>The follow-up examination usually involves taking a chest&nbsp;<a>X-ray</a>&nbsp;so the state of your lungs can be assessed.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(60,59,NULL,NULL,'<h1 >Rubella:</h1>\n<h2>Symptoms of rubella</h2>\n<div>\n<p>The symptoms of rubella usually take two to three weeks to develop after infection.

It may then spread to the chest and tummy (the trunk), and legs and arms. In most cases the rash disappears by itself within three to five days.</p>\n<h2>Swollen lymph glands</h2>\n<p>Lymph nodes, or glands, are small lumps of tissue found throughout the body. They contain white blood cells that help fight bacteria, viruses and anything else that causes infection.</p>\n<p>If you have rubella, the glands will usually swell behind the ears, below your skull at the back of your head, and in your neck. In some cases this swelling can be painful.</p>\n<p>These lymph glands sometimes start to swell before the rash appears, and the swelling can last for several weeks after the rash has gone.</p>\n<h2>Other symptoms</h2>\n<p>As well as a rash and swollen lymph glands, people with rubella may also develop other symptoms, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a high temperature (fever) &ndash; it is usually mild (less than 39C or 102.2F) but can be more severe in adults</li>\n<li><a>cold</a>-like symptoms &ndash; such as a runny nose, watery eyes, sore throat and&nbsp;<a >cough</a></li>\n<li>slightly sore and red eyes&nbsp;<a>(conjunctivitis)</a></li>\n<li>aching and painful joints</li>\n<li>loss of appetite</li>\n<li>tiredness</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These symptoms may develop shortly before the rash and usually last for a few days.</p>\n<h2>Seeking medical advice</h2>\n<p>You should always contact your GP surgery or the 111 service straight away if you suspect rubella. While the condition is usually mild, it\'s important for a doctor to confirm the diagnosis as the symptoms could be caused by a more serious illness.</p>\n<p>If you\'re pregnant and develop a rash, or come into contact with someone who has a rash, contact your GP or midwife immediately.</p>\n<p>It\'s also important that any cases of rubella are reported to the relevant local health authorities so they can track the spread of infection in case there\'s a sudden outbreak of cases.</p>\n<p>Don\'t visit your GP surgery without phoning first, as arrangements may need to be made to reduce the risk of infecting others. In particular, contact with pregnant women should be avoided if possible &ndash; rubella can cause serious problems in an unborn baby, although this is rare nowadays.</p>\n<h2>Diagnosing rubella</h2>\n<div>\n<p>If you suspect rubella, phone your GP surgery or the 111 service straight away for advice.</p>\n<p>Don\'t visit your GP surgery without phoning first, as arrangements may need to be made to reduce the risk of spreading any infection to other people.</p>\n<p>Contact with pregnant women should be avoided as rubella can cause serious problems in an unborn baby, although this is very rare nowadays.</p>\n<p>Your GP should be able to arrange a time for you to visit that won\'t put other people at risk.</p>\n<p>You should keep your child away from school &ndash; or yourself away from work &ndash; until you\'ve seen your GP.</p>\n<p>Your GP may suspect rubella from the symptoms, but as other viral infections often have similar symptoms, testing a sample of saliva or blood is the only way to confirm a diagnosis.</p>\n<h2>Saliva and blood tests</h2>\n<p>If rubella is suspected, a sample of saliva from your mouth or blood taken from a vein in your arm can be taken and tested for certain antibodies.</p>\n<p>Antibodies are proteins your body produces to destroy disease-carrying organisms and toxins. If you have rubella or you\'ve had it in the past, your saliva or blood will test positive for certain antibodies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>IgM antibody &ndash; this will be present if you have a new rubella infection</li>\n<li>IgG antibody &ndash; this will be present if you\'ve had the rubella infection in the past, or you\'ve been vaccinated against it</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If neither antibody is present, you don\'t have rubella and you haven\'t been immunised against it.</p>\n<h2>Diagnosis in pregnancy</h2>\n<p>If you\'re pregnant, you should contact your GP or midwife as soon as possible if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you come into contact with someone who has rubella</li>\n<li>you have a rash or come into contact with anyone who has a rash</li>\n<li>you have&nbsp;<a>symptoms of rubella</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It\'s unlikely you have rubella in these circumstances, but a blood test may be necessary to check for the condition.</p>\n<p>In the rare cases where testing shows you do have rubella, you\'ll be referred to a doctor who specialises in conditions that can affect unborn babies (obstetrician). You may be offered further tests, such as an&nbsp;<a>ultrasound scan</a>, to check for any signs of problems in your baby.</p>\n<p>You\'ll also be offered counselling so you can make an informed decision about whether you wish to continue with the pregnancy if serious problems are found.</p>\n<h2>Treating rubella</h2>\n<div >\n<p>There\'s no specific treatment for rubella. The condition is usually mild and improves without treatment within 7 to 10 days.</p>\n<p>Phone your GP surgery or the 111 service for advice if you suspect rubella. Don\'t visit your GP surgery unless you\'re advised to do so.</p>\n<h2>Treating your symptoms</h2>\n<p>If the&nbsp;<a>symptoms of rubella</a>&nbsp;are causing discomfort for you or your child, there are some things you can do while you wait for the infection to pass.</p>\n<h3>Controlling fever and relieving pain</h3>\n<p>If necessary,&nbsp;<a>paracetamol</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>ibuprofen</a>&nbsp;can be used to reduce a high temperature (fever) and treat any aches or pains.</p>\n<p>Liquid infant paracetamol can be used for young children. Aspirin shouldn\'t be given to children under 16 years old.</p>\n<p>Speak to your pharmacist if you\'re not sure which medications are suitable for your child.</p>\n<p>If your child\'s high temperature is causing them distress, you can also try to reduce it by keeping them cool. A cool, but not cold, compress &ndash; such as a damp flannel held to their forehead &ndash; can help.</p>\n<h3>Drink plenty of fluids</h3>\n<p>If your child has a high temperature, make sure they drink plenty of fluid as they may be at risk of&nbsp;<a>dehydration</a>. Keeping hydrated will also help reduce discomfort caused by coughing.</p>\n<h3>Treating cold-like symptoms</h3>\n<p>If you have&nbsp;<a>cold</a>-like symptoms such as a runny nose,&nbsp;<a>sore throat</a>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<a>cough</a>, there are a number of things you can do to feel more comfortable.</p>\n<p>For example, steam inhalation may offer some relief from a cough. This involves sitting with your head over a bowl of hot water. Place a towel over your head, close your eyes and breathe deeply, while trying not to get the hot steam in your eyes.</p>\n<p>Steam inhalation isn\'t advised for children because of the risk of scalding, but it might help your child if they sit in a hot, steamy bathroom. Alternatively, putting a wet towel on a warm radiator will release more water into the air.</p>\n<p>Giving your child warm drinks, particularly ones containing lemon or honey, may also help to relax their airways, loosen mucus and soothe a cough. Honey shouldn\'t be given to babies under 12 months.</p>\n<h2>Avoiding the spread of infection</h2>\n<p>While you have rubella, it\'s important to reduce the risk of spreading the infection to other people.</p>\n<p>If you or your child have the condition, you should avoid work or school for four days from when you first developed the rubella rash.</p>\n<p>In rare cases, rubella can cause serious problems in an unborn baby, so you should also try to avoid contact with pregnant women for four days from the start of the rash.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(61,60,NULL,NULL,'<h1>Tuberculosis (TB):</h1>\n<h2>Symptoms of tuberculosis</h2>\n<div >\n<p>The symptoms of tuberculosis (TB) depend on where the infection occurs.</p>\n<p>TB usually develops slowly. Your symptoms might not begin until months or even years after you were initially infected.</p>\n<p>In some cases the infection doesn\'t cause any symptoms, which is known as latent TB. It\'s called active TB if you have symptoms.&nbsp;You should contact your GP if you or your child have symptoms of TB.</p>\n<h2>Main symptoms</h2>\n<p>General symptoms of TB include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>lack of appetite and weight loss</li>\n<li>a high temperature (fever)</li>\n<li>night sweats</li>\n<li>extreme tiredness or fatigue</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These symptoms can have many different causes, however, and are not always a sign of TB.</p>\n<h2>Additional symptoms</h2>\n<p>TB can also cause additional symptoms depending on which part of the body is infected.</p>\n<h3>Pulmonary TB</h3>\n<p>Most infections affect the lungs, which can cause:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a persistent&nbsp;<a>cough</a>&nbsp;that lasts more than three weeks and usually brings up phlegm, which may be bloody</li>\n<li><a >breathlessness</a>&nbsp;that gradually gets worse</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is known as pulmonary TB.</p>\n<h3>Extrapulmonary TB</h3>\n<p>Less commonly, TB infections develop in areas outside the lungs, such as the lymph nodes (small glands that form part of the immune system), the bones and joints, the digestive system, the bladder and reproductive system, and the&nbsp;nervous system (brain and nerves).</p>\n<p>This is known as extrapulmonary TB.</p>\n<p>Symptoms of extrapulmonary TB vary, but can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>persistently&nbsp;<a>swollen glands</a></li>\n<li><a>abdominal (tummy) pain</a></li>\n<li>pain and loss of movement in an affected bone or joint</li>\n<li>confusion</li>\n<li>a persistent&nbsp;<a>headache</a></li>\n<li>seizures (fits)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Causes of tuberculosis</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by a type of bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis.</p>\n<p>The condition is spread when a person with an active TB infection in their lungs coughs or sneezes and someone else inhales the expelled droplets, which&nbsp;contain TB bacteria.</p>\n<p>Although it is spread in a similar way to a&nbsp;<a>cold</a>&nbsp;or the&nbsp;<a>flu</a>, TB is not as contagious. You would usually have to spend prolonged periods in close contact with an infected person to catch the infection yourself.</p>\n<p>For example, TB infections usually spread between family members who live in the same house. It would be highly unlikely to become infected by sitting next to an infected person on a bus or train.</p>\n<p>Not everyone with TB is infectious. Generally, children with TB or people with TB that occurs outside the lungs (extrapulmonary TB) do not spread the infection.</p>\n<h2>Latent or active TB</h2>\n<p>In most healthy people the immune system is able to destroy the bacteria that cause TB. However, in some cases the bacteria infect the body but don\'t cause any symptoms (latent TB), or the infection begins to cause symptoms within weeks or months (active TB).</p>\n<p>Up to 10% of people with latent TB eventually develop active TB years after the initial infection. This usually happens when the immune system is weakened&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;for example, during&nbsp;<a>chemotherapy</a>.</p>\n<h2>Who\'s most at risk?</h2>\n<p>Anyone can catch TB, but people particularly at risk include those:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>who live in, come from, or have spent time in a country or area with high levels of TB &ndash; around three in every four TB cases in the UK affect people born outside the UK</li>\n<li>in prolonged close contact with someone who is infected</li>\n<li>living in crowded conditions</li>\n<li>with a condition that weakens their immune system, such as&nbsp;<a>HIV</a></li>\n<li>having treatments that weaken the immune system, such as&nbsp;<a>corticosteroids</a>, chemotherapy or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors (used to treat some types of&nbsp;<a>arthritis</a>&nbsp;and certain gut conditions)</li>\n<li>who are very young or very old &ndash; the immune systems of people who are young or elderly tend to be weaker than those of healthy adults</li>\n<li>in poor health or with a poor diet because of lifestyle and other problems, such as drug misuse,&nbsp;<a>alcohol misuse</a>, or homelessness</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Diagnosing tuberculosis</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Several tests are used to diagnose tuberculosis (TB), depending on the type of TB suspected.</p>\n<p>Your GP may refer you to a TB specialist for testing and treatment if they think you have TB.</p>\n<h2>Pulmonary TB</h2>\n<p>A diagnosis of pulmonary TB (TB that affects the lungs) can be difficult and several tests are usually needed.</p>\n<p>This will include a chest&nbsp;<a>X-ray</a>&nbsp;to look for changes in the appearance of your lungs that are suggestive of TB. Samples of phlegm will also often be taken and checked for the presence of TB bacteria.</p>\n<p>These tests are important in helping to&nbsp;decide on&nbsp;the most effective treatment for you.</p>\n<h2>Extrapulmonary TB</h2>\n<p>If you have suspected extrapulmonary TB (TB that occurs outside the lungs), several tests can be used to confirm a diagnosis. These may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a&nbsp;<a>computerised tomography (CT) scan</a>,&nbsp;<a>magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan</a>, or&nbsp;<a>ultrasound scan</a>&nbsp;of the affected part of the body</li>\n<li>examining the inside of your body with a&nbsp;long, thin, flexible tube that contains a light and camera, which is inserted either through an opening such as your mouth (endoscopy) or a small cut made in your skin (laparoscopy)</li>\n<li>urine and&nbsp;<a>blood tests</a></li>\n<li>a&nbsp;<a>biopsy</a>&nbsp;&ndash; a small sample of tissue or fluid is taken from the affected area and tested for TB bacteria</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may also have a lumbar puncture. This involves taking a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the base of your spine. CSF is&nbsp;fluid that surrounds the brain. It can be checked to see whether TB has infected your central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).</p>\n<h2>Screening for latent TB</h2>\n<p>In some circumstances, you may need to be tested to check for latent TB (when you have been infected with TB bacteria, but do not have any symptoms).</p>\n<p>For example, you may need to be screened if you have been in close contact with someone known to have an active TB infection (an infection that causes symptoms), or if you have recently spent time in a country where TB levels are high.</p>\n<p>If you have just moved to the UK from a country where TB is common, you may be screened when you arrive or your GP may suggest screening when you register as a patient.</p>\n<h3>Mantoux test</h3>\n<p>The Mantoux test is a widely used test for latent TB. It involves injecting a substance called PPD tuberculin into the skin of your forearm. It\'s also called the tuberculin skin test (TST).</p>\n<p>If you have a latent TB infection, your skin will be sensitive to PPD tuberculin and a hard red bump will develop at the site of the injection, usually within 48 to 72 hours of having the test. If you have a very strong skin reaction, you may need a chest X-ray to confirm whether you have an active TB infection.</p>\n<p>If you do not have a latent infection, your skin will not react to the Mantoux test. However, as TB can take a long time to develop, you may need to be screened again at a later stage.</p>\n<p>If you have had the BCG vaccination, you may have a mild skin reaction to the Mantoux test. This does not necessarily mean you have latent TB.</p>\n<h3>Interferon gamma release assay (IGRA)</h3>\n<p>The IGRA is a newer type of blood test for TB that is becoming more widely available.</p>\n<p>The IGRA may be used to help diagnose latent TB:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>if you have a positive Mantoux test</li>\n<li>if you previously had the BCG vaccination (as the Mantoux test may not be reliable in these cases)</li>\n<li>as part of your TB screening if you have just moved to the UK from a country where TB is common</li>\n<li>as part of a health check when you register with a GP</li>\n<li>if you are about to have treatment that will suppress your immune system</li>\n<li>if you are a healthcare worker</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Treating tuberculosis</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Treatment for tuberculosis (TB) will usually involve a long course of&nbsp;<a>antibiotics</a>&nbsp;lasting several months.</p>\n<p>While TB is a serious condition that can be fatal if left untreated, deaths are rare if treatment is completed.</p>\n<p>For most people, a hospital admission during treatment is not necessary.</p>\n<h2>Pulmonary TB</h2>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re diagnosed with active pulmonary TB (TB that affects your lungs and causes symptoms), you will be given a six-month course of a combination of antibiotics. The usual course of treatment is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>two antibiotics (isoniazid and rifampicin) for six months</li>\n<li>two additional antibiotics (pyrazinamide and ethambutol) for the first two months</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It may be several weeks or months before you start to feel better. The exact length of time will depend on your overall health and the severity of your TB.</p>\n<p>After taking the medicine for two weeks, most people are no longer infectious and feel better. However, it is&nbsp;important to continue taking your medicine exactly as prescribed and to complete the whole course of antibiotics.</p>\n<p>Taking medication for six months is the most effective method of ensuring the TB bacteria are killed. If you stop taking your antibiotics before you complete the course, or&nbsp;you skip a dose, the TB infection may become resistant to the antibiotics. This is potentially serious, as it can be difficult to treat and will require a longer course of treatment.</p>\n<p>If you find it difficult to take your medication every day, your treatment team can work with you to find a solution. This may include having regular contact with your treatment team at home, the treatment clinic, or somewhere else that is more convenient.</p>\n<p>If&nbsp;treatment is completed correctly, you should not need any further checks by a TB specialist afterwards. However, you may be given advice about spotting signs that the illness has returned, although this is rare.</p>\n<p>In&nbsp;rare cases TB can be fatal, even with treatment. Death can occur if the lungs become too damaged to work properly.</p>\n<h2>Extrapulmonary TB</h2>\n<p>Extrapulmonary TB (TB that occurs outside the lungs) can be treated using the same combination of antibiotics as those used to treat pulmonary TB. However, you may need to take them for 12 months.</p>\n<p>If you have TB in areas such as your brain or the sac surrounding your heart (pericardium), you may initially be prescribed a&nbsp;<a>corticosteroid</a>&nbsp;such as prednisolone for several weeks to take at the same time as your antibiotics. This will help to reduce any swelling in the affected areas.</p>\n<p>As with pulmonary TB, it\'s important to take your medicines exactly as prescribed and to finish the whole course.</p>\n<h2>Latent TB</h2>\n<p>Latent TB is when you have been infected with the TB bacteria, but do not have any symptoms of active disease. Treatment for latent TB is usually recommended for anyone aged 65 or under.</p>\n<p>However, the antibiotics used to treat TB can cause liver damage in older adults, so treatment for people with latent TB aged 35-65 isn&rsquo;t recommended if this is a concern.</p>\n<p>Latent TB is also not always treated if it\'s thought to be drug-resistant. If this is the case, you may be regularly monitored to check the infection does not become active.</p>\n<p>In some cases, testing and treatment for latent TB may be recommended for people who require treatment that will weaken their immune system, such as long-term corticosteroids,&nbsp;<a>chemotherapy</a>&nbsp;or TNF inhibitors. This is because there is a risk of the infection becoming active.</p>\n<p>Treatment for latent TB generally involves either taking a combination of rifampicin and isoniazid for three months, or isoniazid on its own for six months.</p>\n<h3>Side effects of treatment</h3>\n<p>Isoniazid can cause nerve damage (<a>peripheral neuropathy</a>), but you&rsquo;ll be given supplements of&nbsp;vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) to take alongside it to reduce this risk. Your liver function may be tested before you start treatment.</p>\n<p>In rare cases, the antibiotics used to treat TB can cause eye damage, which can be serious. If you are going to be treated with ethambutol, your vision should also be tested at the beginning of the course of treatment.</p>\n<p>Contact your TB treatment team if you develop any worrying symptoms during treatment, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>being sick&nbsp;</li>\n<li>yellowing of your skin and whites of your eyes (jaundice)</li>\n<li>an unexplained high temperature (fever)</li>\n<li>tingling or numbness in your hands or feet</li>\n<li>a rash or itchy skin</li>\n<li>changes to your vision, such as blurred vision</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rifampicin can reduce the effectiveness of&nbsp;some types of contraception, such as the&nbsp;<a>combined&nbsp;contraceptive pill</a>. Use an alternative method of contraception, such as&nbsp;<a>condoms</a>, while taking rifampicin.</p>\n<h2>Preventing the spread of infection</h2>\n<p>If you are diagnosed with pulmonary TB,&nbsp;you will be contagious up to about two to three weeks into your course of treatment.</p>\n<p>You will not normally need to be isolated during this time, but it\'s important to take some basic precautions to stop TB spreading to your family and friends. You should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>stay away from work, school or college until your TB treatment team advises you it is safe to return&nbsp;</li>\n<li>always cover your mouth&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;preferably with a disposable tissue&nbsp;&ndash; when coughing, sneezing or laughing</li>\n<li>carefully dispose of any used tissues in a sealed plastic bag&nbsp;</li>\n<li>open windows when possible to ensure a good supply of fresh air in the areas where you spend time</li>\n<li>do not sleep in the same room as other people, as you could cough or sneeze in your sleep without realising it</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(62,61,NULL,NULL,'<h1>Whooping cough</h1>\n<h2>About whooping cough</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Whooping cough, also called pertussis, is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the lungs and airways.</p>\n<p>It causes repeated&nbsp;coughing bouts that can last for two&nbsp;to three months or more, and can make babies and young children in particular very ill.</p>\n<p>Whooping cough is spread in&nbsp;the droplets&nbsp;of the coughs or sneezes of someone with the infection.</p>\n<h2>Symptoms of whooping cough</h2>\n<p>The first symptoms&nbsp;of whooping cough are&nbsp;similar to those of a&nbsp;<a>cold</a>, such as&nbsp;a runny nose,&nbsp;red and watery eyes,&nbsp;a sore throat, and&nbsp;a slightly raised temperature.</p>\n<p>Intense&nbsp;coughing bouts start about a week later.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The bouts&nbsp;usually last a few minutes at a time and tend to be more common at night.</li>\n<li>Coughing usually brings up thick&nbsp;mucus and may be followed by vomiting.</li>\n<li>Between coughs, you or your child may gasp for breath&nbsp;&ndash;

The initial symptoms develop three to six days after infection, and can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a high temperature (fever)</li>\n<li >a&nbsp;<a >headache</a></li>\n<li>nausea or vomiting</li>\n<li>muscle pain, including backache</li>\n<li>loss of appetite</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This stage will usually pass after three to four days and most people will make a full recovery.</p>\n<p>However, around 15% of people go on to develop more serious problems, including jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes), kidney failure and bleeding from the mouth, nose, eyes or stomach (causing blood in your vomit and stools).</p>\n<p>Up to half of those who experience these symptoms will die.</p>\n<h2>When to seek medical advice</h2>\n<p>You should see a doctor as soon as possible if you develop symptoms of yellow fever and are currently travelling in an area where the virus is found, or have recently returned from one of these areas.</p>\n<p>To help determine whether you have yellow fever, the doctor will want to know exactly where you have been travelling and what symptoms you have. A&nbsp;<a>blood test</a>&nbsp;will be needed to confirm the diagnosis.</p>\n<h2>Treating yellow fever</h2>\n<p>There is no specific treatment for yellow fever, but you will be monitored and the symptoms can be treated. You will be admitted to hospital for assessment and supportive care.</p>\n<h2>Yellow fever vaccination</h2>\n<p>The vaccination against yellow fever should be given at least 10 days before travelling to an area where the infection is found, to allow your body to develop protection against the virus that causes the infection.</p>\n<p>Some countries require a proof of vaccination certificate before they will let you enter the country. This will only become valid 10 days after you are vaccinated.</p>\n<p>The yellow fever vaccination is given as a single injection and it offers protection to over 95% of those who have it.</p>\n<p>The protection offered by the vaccine is lifelong for most people. Vaccination certificates are also valid for life.</p>\n<p>Even if you have been vaccinated, it&rsquo;s still a good idea to take steps to&nbsp;<a>prevent mosquito bites</a>&nbsp;while you&rsquo;re travelling &ndash; for example, by using mosquito nets, wearing loose, long-sleeved clothing, and applying insect repellent containing 50% DEET to exposed skin.</p>\n<p>Read more about the&nbsp;<a>yellow fever vaccination</a>.</p>\n<h2>Information about you</h2>\n<p>If you have yellow fever, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).</p>\n<p>This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.</p>\n<h2>Yellow fever vaccination</h2>\n<div>\n<p>If you are planning to travel to an area where you may be at risk of yellow fever, make sure you are vaccinated before making your trip.</p>\n<h2>About the yellow fever vaccine</h2>\n<p>The yellow fever vaccine is given as a single injection.</p>\n<p>You should be vaccinated at least 10 days before you travel, as this will allow enough time for your body to develop protection against the yellow fever infection. Your proof of vaccination certificate (see below) will only become valid after this time.</p>\n<p>The vaccination provides protection for 95-100% of those who have it. For most people this protection is lifelong,with some exceptions (see below).</p>\n<h3>Booster doses of yellow fever vaccine</h3>\n<p>Booster doses of the yellow fever vaccine used to be recommended every 10 years for everyone planning another visit to an area where the infection is found.&nbsp;However, booster doses are no longer required for most people.</p>\n<p>From June 2016, vaccination certificates have been valid for the life of the person vaccinated, so a booster dose of yellow fever vaccine can\'t be required to gain entry into a country.</p>\n<p>All certificates, even those issued before 2016, are now considered to be valid for life.</p>\n<p>Booster doses are only recommended if you\'re travelling to an at-risk area and you were originally vaccinated when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you were pregnant</li>\n<li >you were less than two years old</li>\n<li >you had a weakened immune system (for example, due to an&nbsp;<a>HIV</a>&nbsp;infection or preparation for a bone marrow transplant)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your local designated yellow fever vaccination centre (see below) should be able to advise you if you&rsquo;re not sure whether you need to have a booster vaccination before travelling.</p>\n<h2>Where can I be vaccinated against yellow fever?</h2>\n<p>Yellow fever vaccinations can only be given at designated centres. For a centre to become a designated yellow fever vaccination centre, it must register with the appropriate authority. In the UK, this is either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li ><a >Health Protection Scotland (HPS)</a></li>\n<li>the&nbsp;<a>National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a>Find your nearest yellow fever vaccination centre</a>.</p>\n<p>The vaccination is not available for free on the NHS, so you will have to pay for it. On average, a single vaccination costs around &pound;60.</p>\n<h2>Certificate of yellow fever vaccination</h2>\n<p>Under regulations set out by the WHO, anyone travelling to a country or area where there is a risk of picking up or spreading the virus that causes yellow fever must have an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP).</p>\n<p>You can find a&nbsp;<a>list of all the countries that require you to have an ICVP (PDF, 436kb)</a>&nbsp;on the WHO website. You can also search the&nbsp;<a>destination information</a>&nbsp;on the NHS Fit for Travel website to find out whether the places you are visiting require an ICVP. An ICVP is not required for entry into the UK.</p>\n<p>If you lose your certificate, you may be able to get another one reissued as long as you have details of the vaccination batch number and the date you had the vaccination.</p>\n<p>It\'s always a good idea to keep a photocopy or electronic copy of your ICVP. This will make it simpler to get a replacement certificate if the original certificate is lost or damaged.</p>\n<h2>Exemption from yellow fever vaccination</h2>\n<p>Some people may be advised not to have the yellow fever vaccine because of the risk of potential side effects or complications.</p>\n<p>This includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>babies under nine months of age &ndash; babies who are six to nine months old may sometimes be vaccinated, but only if the risk of getting yellow fever during travel is unavoidable</li>\n<li>pregnant and breastfeeding women</li>\n<li>people with weakened immune systems &ndash; such as people with&nbsp;<a>HIV</a>&nbsp;and those receiving&nbsp;<a>radiotherapy</a></li>\n<li>people who are severely allergic to any of the ingredients in the vaccine &ndash; including people with&nbsp;<a>allergies</a>&nbsp;to eggs, as the vaccine contains small amounts of egg</li>\n<li>people over 60 years of age -&nbsp;vaccination is often still advised for people in this age group. A careful assessment and discussion about the risks and benefits of the vaccine, and the risk of the disease in the country you are visiting needs to be carried out by a health professional before deciding if you should receive the vaccine or not</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the yellow fever vaccination is not advised, you may be issued with an exemption letter, which may be accepted by immigration authorities.</p>\n<p>If you have not been vaccinated, you will need to take particular care to&nbsp;<a>prevent mosquito bites</a>&nbsp;while travelling &ndash; for example, by using insect repellent and mosquito nets.</p>\n<p>You may be advised not to travel to a country with yellow fever if you are unable to be vaccinated against the disease.</p>\n<h2>Side effects of the yellow fever vaccine</h2>\n<p>Up to one in every three people experience mild side effects after having the yellow fever vaccine, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a&nbsp;<a>headache</a></li>\n<li>muscle pain</li>\n<li>a mild fever</li>\n<li>soreness at the injection site</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reactions at the injection site usually occur one to five days after being vaccinated. The other side effects may last for up to two weeks.</p>\n<h3>Rare side effects of the yellow fever vaccine</h3>\n<p>There are also some very rare, but potentially serious, side effects that can occur, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>an allergic reaction to the vaccine; this occurs around once for every 130,000 doses given</li>\n<li>yellow fever vaccine-associated neurological disease (YEL-AND) &ndash; a condition affecting the brain and nervous system, causing symptoms such as confusion and problems with movement and co-ordination; this occurs around once for every 250,000 doses given</li>\n<li>yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD) &ndash; a condition affecting your internal organs, which can lead to organ failure in some cases; this occurs around once for every 330,000 doses given</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The risk of YEL-AND and YEL-AVD is higher in young babies and elderly people, which is why vaccination is not always recommended for these groups.</p>\n<p>If you have recently received the yellow fever vaccine and feel unwell please contact your GP or the&nbsp;<a>NHS 24&nbsp;111 service</a>&nbsp;if your GP practice is closed.</p>\n</div>\n</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(64,63,NULL,NULL,'<h1>Broken or knocked-out tooth:</h1>\n<p>Knocking out a tooth is a medical emergency.</p>\n<p>If an adult tooth is knocked out, try putting it back in place and go to&nbsp;a dentist immediately. Don\'t try to re-insert a baby tooth&nbsp;&ndash; take your child to a dentist&nbsp;immediately.</p>\n<p>If you can\'t put an adult tooth back into position, place it in milk and contact your usual dental practice. You may be able to see a dentist straight away or you may be directed to an urgent care dental service.</p>\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a regular dentist,&nbsp;phone the&nbsp;<a>NHS 24</a>&nbsp;\'111\' service for advice on where to get urgent care.</p>\n<p>If the tooth is just chipped, you should make&nbsp;an appointment to see a dentist to fill the tooth or smooth it down.

Take your child to see a dentist immediately.</p>\n<h3>At the dentist</h3>\n<p>If you\'ve put your tooth back in yourself, the dentist will check that it\'s in the correct position by having a look and taking an&nbsp;<a>X-ray</a>. They\'ll splint it to the teeth either side to hold it in position for two weeks.&nbsp;Splinting is a technique that temporarily attaches the tooth to keep it in place.</p>\n<p>If you\'ve put your tooth in milk and gone straight to the dentist, the dentist will numb the affected area and reposition the tooth. They\'ll check that it&rsquo;s in the correct position by taking an X-ray before&nbsp;splinting it to the teeth either side for two weeks.</p>\n<h2>A lost tooth</h2>\n<p>If you can\'t find your tooth, the space can be filled with one of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a>denture</a>&nbsp;&ndash; a removable false tooth that you have to take out to clean</li>\n<li>bridge &ndash; where a&nbsp;false tooth is glued to the teeth either side using a special cement&nbsp;</li>\n<li>implant &ndash; where a&nbsp;titanium screw is placed in the jaw bone, and after a few months a mould is taken so that a false tooth can be made</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of the above treatments&nbsp;can be provided on the NHS.

Not everyone needs to have missing teeth replaced&nbsp;&ndash; some people don\'t mind having a gap. Speak to your dentist about your options, to help you decide what you would like.</p>\n<h2>A&nbsp;broken or chipped tooth</h2>\n<p>If&nbsp;you have broken your tooth, try to find the fragment, store it in milk and see a dentist as soon as possible during working hours. The dentist may be able to glue the fragment back on to the tooth.</p>\n<p>Don\'t worry if you can&rsquo;t find the fragment, your dentist will be able to use a tooth-coloured filling material to build your tooth up. If part of a back tooth is broken, it may either need a filling or a crown (also known as a cap).</p>\n<p>If the tooth is badly broken and the nerves are exposed, it may be a little sensitive and&nbsp;may even need root canal treatment. This involves removing the nerve and placing a root filling.</p>\n<h2>Protecting your teeth during sports</h2>\n<p>If you play a sport, such as rugby or hockey, where there\'s a risk of being hit in the mouth, you may want to consider getting a mouthguard made by a dentist to protect your teeth.</p>\n<p>This involves taking a mould of your teeth, which will be used to make the mouthguard &ndash; this will fit well and protect your mouth.</p>\n<p>\"Boil and bite\" mouthguards, where the mouthguard is moulded using hot water,&nbsp;are also available, but they\'re not as good as one made by your dentist. This type of mouthguard is often uncomfortable&nbsp;to wear and doesn&rsquo;t provide the same level of protection as a custom-made mouthguard.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(65,64,NULL,NULL,'<h1>Concussion:</h1>\n<h2>Symptoms of concussion</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Symptoms of concussion can be mild to severe, and in some cases emergency treatment may be needed.</p>\n<p>The most common symptoms of concussion are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>confusion, such as being unaware of your surroundings, a delay&nbsp;in answering questions,&nbsp;or having a blank expression&nbsp;</li>\n<li>headache</li>\n<li>dizziness</li>\n<li>nausea</li>\n<li>loss of balance</li>\n<li>feeling stunned or dazed</li>\n<li>disturbances with vision, such as&nbsp;double vision, blurred vision&nbsp;or \"seeing stars\" or flashing lights</li>\n<li>difficulties with memory</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Difficulties with memory can mean:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you are unable to remember events that occurred before the concussion happened (this usually only affects the minutes immediately leading up to the concussion)&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;retrograde amnesia&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>you are unable to remember any new information or events after the concussion happened&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;anterograde amnesia</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both&nbsp;types of memory loss&nbsp;usually improve within a few hours.</p>\n<h2>Less common symptoms</h2>\n<p>Less common symptoms include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>loss of consciousness</li>\n<li>slurred speech</li>\n<li>changes in behaviour, such as feeling unusually irritable</li>\n<li>inappropriate emotional responses, such as suddenly bursting into laughter or tears</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>When to seek medical advice</h2>\n<p>As a precaution, it is recommended that you visit your nearest accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department if you or someone in your care has a head injury resulting in concussion and then develops any of the following signs and symptoms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>loss of consciousness from which the person then recovers</li>\n<li>amnesia (memory loss), such as not being able to remember what happened before or after the injury</li>\n<li>persistent headaches since the injury</li>\n<li>changes in behaviour, such as irritability, being easily distracted or having no interest in the outside world &ndash; this is a particularly common sign in children under the age of five</li>\n<li>confusion</li>\n<li>drowsiness that goes on for longer than an hour when you would normally be awake</li>\n<li>a&nbsp;large bruise or wound to the head or face</li>\n<li>prolonged vision problems, such as double vision</li>\n<li>reading or writing problems</li>\n<li>balance problems or difficulty walking</li>\n<li>loss of power in part of the body, such as weakness in an arm or leg</li>\n<li>clear fluid leaking from the nose or ears (this could be cerebrospinal fluid, which normally surrounds the brain)</li>\n<li>a black eye with no other damage around the eye</li>\n<li>sudden deafness in one or both ears</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anyone taking warfarin should seek medical assistance after a head injury, even if they feel well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Anyone who is drunk or high on recreational drugs should also go to A&amp;E if they have a head injury. It\'s often easy for others around them to miss signs of a more severe head injury.</p>\n<p>Certain things&nbsp;make you more vulnerable to the effects of a head injury, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>being aged 65 or older</li>\n<li>a previous history of&nbsp;brain surgery</li>\n<li>having a condition that makes you bleed more easily, such as haemophilia, or having a condition that makes your blood more prone to clotting, such as thrombophilia</li>\n<li>taking anticoagulant medication (such as&nbsp;<a>warfarin</a>) to prevent blood clots, or taking&nbsp;<a>low-dose aspirin</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>When to seek emergency medical treatment</h2>\n<p>You should phone 999 for an ambulance immediately if&nbsp;the person:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>remains unconscious after the initial injury</li>\n<li>is having difficulty staying awake, speaking or understanding what people are saying</li>\n<li>is having a seizure or fit</li>\n<li>has been vomiting since the injury</li>\n<li>is bleeding from one or both ears</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Causes of concussion</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Concussion occurs when a blow or impact to the head causes a sudden disruption to part of the brain known as the reticular activating system (RAS).</p>\n<p>The RAS is located in the middle of your brain, and helps regulate your sense of awareness and consciousness. It also acts as a filter that allows you to ignore unimportant information by focusing on details you need.</p>\n<p>For example, your RAS helps you to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>fall asleep and wake up as required</li>\n<li>suddenly hear when your flight is being called in a noisy airport</li>\n<li>notice news items that interest you when you are quickly scanning a newspaper or news website</li>\n</ul>\n<p>During a head injury severe enough to cause concussion, your brain is moved out of its normal position for a short time. This rotation disrupts the electrical activities of&nbsp;brain cells that make up the RAS, which in turn triggers&nbsp;symptoms associated with concussion, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>loss of memory&nbsp;</li>\n<li>a brief period of unconsciousness</li>\n<li>mental confusion</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Increased risk</h2>\n<p>The three main causes of concussion are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>being involved in a road accident</li>\n<li>an accidental trip or&nbsp;<a>fall</a></li>\n<li>taking part in sporting or other recreational activities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Activities known to have a higher-than-average risk of concussion include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>rugby</li>\n<li>football</li>\n<li>cycling</li>\n<li>boxing</li>\n<li>martial arts, such as karate or judo</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most doctors would argue that the physical benefits of regularly taking part in these sports outweigh any potential risks associated with concussion.</p>\n<p>But this is only if you (or your child) wear appropriate equipment, such as a helmet, and&nbsp;are&nbsp;supervised by a suitably trained referee, umpire or trainer with experience&nbsp;of diagnosing and treating concussion.</p>\n<p>The exception to this is boxing, as most doctors&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;especially those who treat head injuries&nbsp;&ndash; have stated that the risks of serious brain injury associated with boxing are unacceptably high and the sport should be made illegal.</p>\n<h2>Diagnosing concussion</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Because of the nature of concussion, most diagnoses are either made at an accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department, by a paramedic at the scene of an accident, or by a trained official at a sporting event.</p>\n<p>The person making the diagnosis will&nbsp;perform a careful physical examination to check if there are any noticeable signs and symptoms of a more serious brain injury, such as bleeding from the ears, while making sure breathing is unaffected.</p>\n<p>If you are conscious, you will be questioned so your state of mind (particularly your memory) can be assessed.</p>\n<p>Possible questions include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where are we?</li>\n<li>What were you doing before the concussion?</li>\n<li>Can you repeat the months of the year in reverse order?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may be asked to try what is known as the \"finger-nose-finger\" test. The person running the test will hold one of their fingers in front of you. You are asked to touch their finger and then touch the tip of your nose as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>This test is a good way of assessing what effect the concussion has had on your balance and co-ordination.</p>\n<p>If you are unconscious, as a precaution it is assumed that&nbsp;you have a serious neck or spinal injury until proved otherwise. You should therefore not&nbsp;be moved until a specialist brace can be fitted around your neck and spine to protect it.</p>\n<p>Similarly, if you see a person who is unconscious, make no attempt to move them unless they are in immediate physical danger. Instead, dial 999 for an ambulance and wait with them until paramedics arrive.</p>\n<h2>Further testing</h2>\n<p>In some circumstances, further testing may be recommended if there are any signs or symptoms that suggest a more serious injury to your brain.&nbsp;The most widely used test for suspected brain injury is a&nbsp;<a>computerised tomography (CT) scan</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, if it is thought you may have damaged the bones in your neck, an&nbsp;<a>X-ray</a>&nbsp;may be used to assess the damage quickly. CT scans are avoided on children under 10 where possible, but may be necessary in some cases.</p>\n<p>A CT scan takes a series of X-rays of the inside of your skull and puts them together using a computer. The image that is created forms a cross-section of the inside of your skull and brain.</p>\n<h3>Adults</h3>\n<p>A CT scan is usually recommended in adults who:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>have persistent problems in speaking, carrying out instructions or opening their eyes</li>\n<li>have signs and symptoms that suggest the base of the skull is fractured, such as clear fluid running from the nose or ears, or very dark blotches above and below the eyes (\"panda eyes\")</li>\n<li>have a seizure or fit after the injury</li>\n<li>have vomited&nbsp;more than once since the injury</li>\n<li>are unable to remember events more than 30 minutes before the injury</li>\n<li>have any signs of neurological problems, such as loss of feeling in certain parts of the body, problems with balance and walking, and persistent changes in eyesight</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A CT scan is also recommended for adults who have experienced some loss of consciousness or memory since the injury and who:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>are aged 65 or over</li>\n<li>have a problem that makes them prone to uncontrollable bleeding, such as a blood clotting disorder (for example,&nbsp;haemophilia)&nbsp;or are taking the anticoagulant medication&nbsp;<a>warfarin</a></li>\n<li>were injured in a particularly serious accident, such as a road accident or falling from a height of more than one metre</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Children</h3>\n<p>A CT scan may be recommended in children who:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>lost consciousness for more than five minutes</li>\n<li>are unable to remember what happened before or after the injury and this has lasted more than five minutes</li>\n<li>are unusually drowsy</li>\n<li>have been sick three times or more since the injury</li>\n<li>had a seizure or fit after the injury</li>\n<li>have signs and symptoms that suggest the base of the skull is fractured, such as \"panda eyes\"</li>\n<li>have memory loss</li>\n<li>have a large bruise or wound to the face or head</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Treating concussion</h2>\n<div>\n<p>There are a number of self care techniques you can use to relieve mild concussion symptoms. If more serious symptoms start to develop, seek immediate medical treatment.</p>\n<p>Some self care techniques for mild symptoms of concussion are outlined below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>apply&nbsp;a cold compress to the injury to reduce swelling &ndash;&nbsp;a bag of frozen vegetables&nbsp;wrapped in a towel&nbsp;could be used, but never place ice directly on&nbsp;the skin as it\'s too cold; apply the compress every two to four&nbsp;hours and leave it in place for 20 to 30 minutes</li>\n<li>take&nbsp;<a >paracetamol</a>&nbsp;to control pain &ndash; do not use&nbsp;<a>non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)</a>&nbsp;painkillers such as&nbsp;<a >ibuprofen</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>aspirin</a>&nbsp;as these can sometimes cause bleeding at the site of the injury</li>\n<li>get plenty of rest&nbsp;and avoid&nbsp;stressful situations where possible</li>\n<li>avoid drinking any alcohol or taking recreational drugs</li>\n<li>only return to work, college or school when you feel you have completely recovered</li>\n<li>only drive a car or ride a bike when you feel you have completely recovered</li>\n<li>do not play any contact sports for at least three weeks&nbsp;without seeing your GP first &ndash; this includes sports&nbsp;such as football&nbsp;and rugby</li>\n<li>make sure you have someone to stay with you for the first 48 hours after the injury &ndash;&nbsp;this is in case you experience more serious follow-up symptoms</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>When to seek follow-up advice</h2>\n<p>Sometimes the symptoms of a more serious brain injury do not occur for several hours, or possibly days, after the initial injury has taken place. This means&nbsp;it\'s important that&nbsp;you remain alert for signs and symptoms that could suggest a more serious injury has occurred.</p>\n<p>If you or someone in your care has any of the signs or symptoms listed below, go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department as soon as possible:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>unconsciousness or lack of consciousness, such as problems keeping your eyes open</li>\n<li>mental confusion, such as forgetting who or where you are</li>\n<li>any drowsiness that goes on for longer than one hour when you would normally be wide awake</li>\n<li>any problems understanding or speaking</li>\n<li>any loss of balance or problems walking</li>\n<li>any weakness in one or both arms or legs</li>\n<li>any problems with eyesight</li>\n<li>a very painful headache that will not go away</li>\n<li>any vomiting</li>\n<li>any fits or seizures</li>\n<li>clear fluid coming out of the ear or nose</li>\n<li>bleeding from one or both ears</li>\n<li>sudden deafness in one or both ears</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Returning to sports</h2>\n<p>Despite being one of the most common sport-related injuries, there is no internationally agreed consensus on&nbsp;advice about when it is safe to return to playing a contact sport, such as rugby, after a concussion.</p>\n<p>Most national sporting federations and organisations recommend a \"step-wise\" approach, where you wait until you are free&nbsp;from symptoms and then resume a low level of physical activity.</p>\n<p>If the symptoms do not return, you can step up to a more intense level of activity. If symptoms are still under control,&nbsp;continue to step up through the levels, eventually returning to playing the sport.</p>\n<p>A 2013 conference of experts in sports medicine recommended these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>complete rest until symptoms have passed for at least 24 hours</li>\n<li>light aerobic exercise, such as walking and cycling</li>\n<li>sport-specific exercises, such as running drills for football or rugby (but no activity that involves impact to the head)</li>\n<li>non-contact training, such as passing drills for football</li>\n<li>full training, including physical contact such as tackling</li>\n<li>return to play</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you are symptom-free, you should be able to return to play within a week.

Certain medical conditions also cause blisters to appear.</p>\n<p>The damaged upper layer of skin (epidermis) tears away&nbsp;from the layers beneath and fluid (serum)&nbsp;collects in the space to create a blister.</p>\n<h2>Friction</h2>\n<p>Friction blisters are common in people who are very active, such as sports players and those&nbsp;in the military. They\'re usually caused by poor-fitting shoes.</p>\n<p>A blister can develop if the skin is rubbed for a long period or if there\'s intense rubbing over shorter periods.</p>\n<p>Friction blisters often occur on the feet and&nbsp;hands, which can rub against shoes and handheld equipment, such as tools or sports equipment. Blisters also form more easily on moist skin and are more likely to occur in warm conditions.</p>\n<h2>Skin reaction</h2>\n<p>Blisters can appear when skin is exposed to excessive heat &ndash; for example, when you have sunburn.</p>\n<p>Blisters can sometimes form when your skin comes into contact with substances such as cosmetics, detergents and solvents.</p>\n<h2>Medical conditions</h2>\n<p>A&nbsp;number of medical conditions may cause blisters. The most common are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a>chickenpox</a>&nbsp;&ndash; a childhood illness that causes itchy red spots</li>\n<li><a>cold sores</a>&nbsp;&ndash; small blisters that develop on the lips or around the mouth, caused by a virus</li>\n<li><a>herpes</a>&nbsp;&ndash; a sexually transmitted infection (STI) that most commonly affects the groin&nbsp;</li>\n<li><a>impetigo</a>&nbsp;&ndash; a contagious bacterial skin infection</li>\n<li>pompholyx &ndash; a type of eczema</li>\n<li><a >scabies</a>&nbsp;&ndash; a skin condition, caused by tiny mites, which may lead to blisters developing on young children\'s feet or palms of their hands</li>\n<li><a>hand, foot and mouth disease</a>&nbsp;&ndash; a viral infection that usually affects young children</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Several&nbsp;rarer conditions can also cause blisters. They are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>bullous pemphigoid&nbsp;&ndash; a skin disease that causes large blisters and usually affects people over 60 years of age&nbsp;</li>\n<li>pemphigus vulgaris &ndash; a serious skin condition where blisters develop if pressure is applied to the skin; the blisters burst easily, leaving raw areas that can become infected</li>\n<li>dermatitis herpetiformis&nbsp;&ndash; a skin condition that causes intensely itchy blisters, usually on the elbows, knees, back and buttocks; blisters usually develop in patches of the same shape and size on both sides of the body</li>\n<li>epidermolysis bullosa &ndash; a group of rare inherited skin disorders that cause the skin to become very fragile; any trauma or friction to the skin can cause painful blisters</li>\n<li>chronic bullous dermatosis of childhood &ndash; a condition that causes clusters of blisters to develop on the face, mouth or genitals</li>\n<li>bullous ichthyosiform erythroderma &ndash; a type of icthyosis someone is born with, which causes inflamed, scaly skin with blisters</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Treating blisters</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Most blisters heal naturally and don\'t require medical attention.</p>\n<p>As new skin grows underneath the blister, your body slowly reabsorbs the fluid in the blister and the skin on top will dry and peel off.</p>\n<h2>When to seek medical help</h2>\n<p>See your GP if you have blisters that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you think are infected &ndash; an infected blister will be filled with yellow or green pus and may be painful, red and hot</li>\n<li>are&nbsp;very painful</li>\n<li>keep coming back</li>\n<li>are in unusual places, such as on your eyelids or inside your mouth</li>\n<li>are caused by severe sunburn,&nbsp;<a>burns or scalds</a>&nbsp;or an&nbsp;<a>allergic reaction</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a>Antibiotics</a>&nbsp;may be prescribed to treat an infected blister.</p>\n<p>If you have a large or painful blister, your GP may decide to decompress the blister under sterile conditions.</p>\n<p>If your blisters are caused by a medical condition, such as&nbsp;<a>chickenpox</a>,&nbsp;<a>herpes</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>impetigo</a>, your GP will be able to advise you about how to treat the underlying condition.</p>\n<h2>Friction blisters</h2>\n<p>The unbroken skin over a blister provides a natural barrier to infection. It\'s important that the&nbsp;skin remains intact to avoid infection.</p>\n<p>As tempting as it may be, try not to pierce a blister with a needle because it could lead to an infection or slow down the healing process. Allow the skin to peel off on its own after the skin beneath has healed.</p>\n<p>You may choose to cover small blisters&nbsp;with a plaster. Larger blisters can be covered with a gauze pad or dressing that can be taped in place.</p>\n<p>Painful blisters, or those in positions where they\'re likely to burst, such as on the sole of your foot, can be covered with a soft dressing to cushion and protect them. It may help to cut the dressing into a \'doughnut\' shape to fit around the blister and avoid placing pressure directly on it.</p>\n<p>Change the dressing daily and wash your hands before touching the blister to avoid infection.</p>\n<h2>Burst blisters</h2>\n<p>If a blister has burst, don\'t peel off the dead skin on top of the blister. Allow the fluid inside to drain and wash it with mild soap and water. Cover the blister and the area around it with a dry, sterile dressing to protect it from infection until it heals.</p>\n<p>Hydrocolloid dressings, available over the counter from pharmacies, have been shown to help prevent discomfort and encourage healing.</p>\n<p>If the top layer of dead skin from a burst blister has already rubbed off, don\'t pick at the edges of the remaining skin. Follow the advice above to protect it from infection.</p>\n<p>If the blister is on your foot, avoid wearing the shoes that caused it, at least until it heals.</p>\n<h2>Blood blisters</h2>\n<p>Blood blisters should be left to heal naturally. If a blood blister bursts, keep the area clean and dry. Protect it with a sterile dressing to prevent infection.</p>\n<p>Blood blisters are often painful. Applying an ice pack to the affected area immediately after the injury can help relieve the pain (a bag of frozen vegetables works just as well). Between 10 and 30 minutes should help.</p>\n<p>To stop&nbsp;the ice touching your skin directly, place a towel over the affected area before applying the ice pack.</p>\n</div>\n</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(69,68,NULL,NULL,'<h1>Cuts and grazes</h1>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h2>About cuts and grazes</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Most cuts and grazes are minor and can be easily treated at home.</p>\n<p>Stopping the bleeding, cleaning the wound thoroughly and covering it with a plaster or dressing is usually all that\'s needed.</p>\n<p>Minor wounds should start to heal within a few days.</p>\n<h2 >How to treat cuts and grazes</h2>\n<h3>Stop the bleeding</h3>\n<p>Stop&nbsp;any bleeding before applying a dressing to the wound.

The lump may have an inflamed (red and swollen) area around it that may be filled with fluid. This is called a weal.</p>\n<p>Insect bites and stings usually clear up within several hours and can be safely treated at home.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Insect bites</h2>\n<p>The symptoms that can occur from different types of insect bites are described below.</p>\n<h3>Midges, mosquitoes and gnats</h3>\n<p>Bites from midges, mosquitoes and gnats often cause small papules (lumps) to form on your skin that are usually very itchy. If you\'re particularly sensitive to insect bites, you may develop:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>bullae&nbsp;&ndash; fluid-filled blisters</li>\n<li>weals&nbsp;&ndash; circular, fluid-filled areas surrounding the bite</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mosquito bites in certain areas of tropical countries can cause&nbsp;<a>malaria</a>.</p>\n<h3>Fleas</h3>\n<p>Flea bites can be grouped in lines or clusters. If you\'re particularly sensitive to flea bites, they can lead to a condition called papular&nbsp;<a>urticaria</a>, where a number of itchy red lumps form. Bullae may also develop.</p>\n<p>Fleas from cats and dogs can often bite below the knee, commonly around the ankles. You may also get flea bites on your forearms if you\'ve been stroking or holding your pet.</p>\n<h3>Horseflies</h3>\n<p>A bite from a horsefly can be very painful. As well as the formation of a weal around the bite, you may also experience:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>urticaria&nbsp;&ndash; a rash of weals (also called hives, welts or nettle rash)</li>\n<li>dizziness</li>\n<li>weakness</li>\n<li>wheezing</li>\n<li>angio-oedema&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;itchy, pale pink or red swellings that often occur around the eyes and lips for short periods of time</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Horseflies cut the skin when they bite, rather than piercing it, so horsefly bites can take a long time to heal and can cause an infection.</p>\n<h3>Bedbugs</h3>\n<p>Bites from bedbugs aren\'t usually painful, and if you\'ve not been bitten by bedbugs before, you may not have any symptoms.</p>\n<p>If you have been bitten before, you may develop intensely irritating weals or lumps.</p>\n<p>Bedbug bites often occur on your:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>face</li>\n<li>neck</li>\n<li>hands</li>\n<li>arms</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Blandford fly</h3>\n<p>The Blandford fly (sometimes called blackfly) is usually found near rivers. It\'s common&nbsp;in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dorset</li>\n<li>East Anglia</li>\n<li>Oxfordshire</li>\n<li>Herefordshire</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, there have also been reports of Blandford fly bites occurring in other areas of England.</p>\n<p>You\'re most at risk of being bitten by a Blandford fly in May and June. Bites often occur on the legs and are very painful.</p>\n<p>They can produce a severe localised reaction (a reaction confined to the area of the bite) with symptoms such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>swelling</li>\n<li>blistering</li>\n<li>a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or over</li>\n<li>joint pain</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Arachnid bites</h2>\n<h3>Ticks</h3>\n<p>Tick bites aren\'t usually painful and sometimes only cause a red lump to develop where you were bitten. However, in some cases they may cause:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>swelling</li>\n<li>itchiness</li>\n<li>blistering</li>\n<li>bruising</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ticks can carry a bacterial infection called Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes&nbsp;<a>Lyme disease</a>. Lyme disease&nbsp;can be serious if it isn\'t treated.</p>\n<h3>Mites</h3>\n<p>Mites cause very itchy lumps to&nbsp;develop on the skin and can also cause&nbsp;<a>blisters</a>. If the mites are from pets, you may be bitten on your abdomen (tummy) and thighs if your pet has been sitting on your lap. Otherwise, mites will bite any uncovered skin.</p>\n<h3>Spiders</h3>\n<p>Spider bites from spiders native to the UK are rare. You\'re more likely to be bitten by a spider while you\'re abroad,&nbsp;if you keep non-native spiders as&nbsp;pets, or if you have a job that involves handling goods from overseas.</p>\n<p>Spider bites leave&nbsp;small puncture marks on the skin, which can be painful and cause redness and swelling.</p>\n<p>In severe cases, a spider bite may cause&nbsp;nausea, vomiting, sweating and dizziness. Very rarely, a spider bite may cause a severe allergic reaction.</p>\n<h2>Insect stings</h2>\n<h3>Wasps and hornets</h3>\n<p>A&nbsp;wasp or hornet&nbsp;sting&nbsp;causes a sharp pain in the area that\'s been&nbsp;stung, which usually lasts just a few seconds.</p>\n<p>A&nbsp;swollen red mark will often then&nbsp;form on your skin, which can be itchy and painful.</p>\n<h3>Bees</h3>\n<p>A bee sting feels similar to a wasp sting, but the sting and a venomous sac will be left in the wound. You should remove this immediately by scraping it out using something with a hard edge, such as a bank card.</p>\n<p>Don\'t pinch the sting out with your fingers or tweezers because you may spread the venom.</p>\n<h2>Allergic reaction</h2>\n<p>Most people won\'t have severe symptoms after being bitten or stung by an insect, but some people can react badly to them&nbsp;because they\'ve developed antibodies to the venom.</p>\n<p>You\'re more likely to have an&nbsp;<a>allergic reaction</a>&nbsp;if you\'re stung by an insect. The reaction can be classed as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a minor localised reaction &ndash; this is normal and doesn\'t require&nbsp;<a>allergy testing</a>, although the affected area will often be painful for a few days</li>\n<li>a large localised reaction (LLR) &ndash; this can cause other symptoms, such as swelling, itching and a rash</li>\n<li>a systemic reaction (SR) &ndash; this often requires immediate medical attention because it can cause a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction&nbsp;<a>(anaphylaxis)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although insect bites and stings are a common cause of anaphylaxis, it\'s rare to experience anaphylaxis after an insect sting, and it\'s rarely fatal.</p>\n<p>Large localised reactions and systemic reactions are described in more detail below.</p>\n<h3>Large localised reaction (LLR)</h3>\n<p>If you have a&nbsp;large localised reaction&nbsp;(LLR) after being bitten or stung by an insect, a large area around the bite or sting will swell up. The area may measure up to 30cm (12in) across, or your entire arm or leg could swell up.</p>\n<p>The swelling will usually last longer than 48 hours, but should start to go down after a few days. This can be painful, but the swelling won\'t be dangerous unless it affects your airways.</p>\n<p>If you\'re bitten or stung many times by one or more insects, your symptoms will be more severe because a larger amount of venom will have been injected.</p>\n<p>You may have an LLR several hours after being bitten or stung. This could include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a rash</li>\n<li>nausea</li>\n<li>painful or swollen joints</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Systemic reaction (SR)</h3>\n<p>You\'re more likely to have a systemic reaction (SR) if you\'ve been bitten or stung before and become sensitised, particularly if it was recently. People who\'ve been sensitised to bee stings are more likely to have an SR than people who are stung by wasps.</p>\n<p>Dial 999 immediately to request an ambulance if you\'ve been bitten or stung and have any of the following symptoms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>wheezing, hoarseness or difficulty breathing</li>\n<li>nausea, vomiting or&nbsp;<a>diarrhoea</a></li>\n<li>a fast heart rate</li>\n<li>dizziness or feeling faint</li>\n<li>difficulty swallowing&nbsp;<a>(dysphagia)</a></li>\n<li>a swollen face or mouth</li>\n<li>confusion,&nbsp;anxiety or agitation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It\'s rare for an SR to be fatal, particularly in children, although someone with an existing heart or breathing problem is at an&nbsp;increased risk.</p>\n<h2>Treating insect bites and stings</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Most insect bites and stings cause small reactions that are confined to the area of the bite (localised reactions). They can usually be treated at home.</p>\n<p>However, see your GP as soon as possible&nbsp;if your symptoms are severe.</p>\n<h2>Removing a sting</h2>\n<p>As soon as you\'ve been stung by a bee, remove the sting and venom sac if it\'s been left in your skin. Do this by scraping it out, either with your fingernails or something with a hard edge, such as a bank card.</p>\n<p>When removing the sting, be careful not to spread the venom further under your skin and don\'t puncture the venom sac.</p>\n<p>Don\'t pinch the sting out with your fingers or a pair of tweezers because you may spread the venom. If a child has been stung, an adult should remove the sting.</p>\n<p>Wasps and hornets don\'t usually leave the sting behind, so they could sting you again. If you\'ve been stung and the wasp or hornet is still in the area, walk away calmly to avoid being stung again.</p>\n<h2>Basic treatment</h2>\n<p>Most insect bites and stings cause itching and swelling that usually clears up within several hours.</p>\n<p>Minor bites and stings can be treated by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>washing the&nbsp;affected area&nbsp;with soap and water</li>\n<li>placing a cold compress (a flannel or cloth cooled with cold water) over the affected area to reduce swelling</li>\n<li>not scratching the&nbsp;area&nbsp;as&nbsp;it can become infected (keep children\'s fingernails short and clean)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See&nbsp;your GP if the redness and&nbsp;itching gets worse&nbsp;or doesn\'t clear up after a few days. &nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Additional treatment</h2>\n<p>If the bite or sting is painful or swollen, you can also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>wrap an ice pack, such as a bag of frozen peas, in a towel and place it on the swelling</li>\n<li>take painkillers, such as&nbsp;<a>paracetamol</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>ibuprofen</a>&nbsp;(children under 16 years of age shouldn\'t be given aspirin)</li>\n<li>use a spray or cream that contains&nbsp;<a>local anaesthetic</a>,&nbsp;antihistamine or&nbsp;mild hydrocortisone (1%) on the affected area to prevent itching and swelling</li>\n<li>take an antihistamine tablet to help reduce swelling (antihistamine tablets are available on prescription or from pharmacies)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If local swelling is severe, your GP may prescribe a short course of oral&nbsp;<a>corticosteroids</a>, such as prednisolone, to take for three to five&nbsp;days.</p>\n<p>If you have an&nbsp;<a>allergic reaction</a>&nbsp;after being bitten or stung, even if it\'s just a skin rash (hives), your GP may prescribe an adrenaline pen (an auto-injector) and show you&nbsp;how to use it. You\'ll also be referred to an allergy clinic for further tests and treatment.</p>\n<h3>Blisters</h3>\n<p>If you develop&nbsp;<a>blisters</a>&nbsp;after being bitten by an insect, don\'t burst them because they may become infected.</p>\n<p>Blisters don\'t usually cause pain unless they rupture (burst) and expose the new skin underneath. If possible, use an adhesive bandage (plaster) to protect the blistered area.</p>\n<h3>Infected bites</h3>\n<p>See your GP if the bite or&nbsp;sting fills with pus and feels tender to touch, your glands swell up and you feel unwell with&nbsp;<a>flu-like symptoms</a>.</p>\n<p>Your GP may prescribe oral&nbsp;<a>antibiotics</a>&nbsp;(medicines to treat infections caused by bacteria). You\'ll need to take these as instructed, usually two to four times a day for seven days.</p>\n<h2>Allergic reaction</h2>\n<p>Dial 999 to request an ambulance if&nbsp;you have swelling or itching anywhere else on your body after being bitten or stung, or if you\'re wheezing or have difficulty swallowing.&nbsp;You\'ll need emergency medical treatment.</p>\n<p>If you have the&nbsp;symptoms of a systemic reaction (SR), it could lead to anaphylactic shock.&nbsp;<a>Anaphylaxis</a>&nbsp;may need to be treated with an adrenaline injection, antihistamines, oxygen or an intravenous drip directly into a vein.</p>\n<h2>Allergy clinics</h2>\n<p>If previous insect bites or stings&nbsp;have caused a large skin reaction, such as redness and swelling more than 10cm (4 inches) in diameter, your GP may refer you to an allergy clinic.</p>\n<p>The criteria for referring someone to an allergy clinic may vary depending on what\'s available in your local area.</p>\n<p>Immunotherapy (desensitisation or hyposensitisation) is a possible treatment option if you\'re allergic to wasp or bee stings.</p>\n<p>It involves being injected with small doses of venom every week to alter your body\'s immune response to venom.</p>\n<p>You need to be observed after each injection to make sure you don\'t have an allergic reaction to the treatment.</p>\n<p>Over time, your body becomes used to the venom (desensitised) and&nbsp;you\'re no longer at risk of anaphylaxis.</p>\n<p>When a high enough dose has been reached, the injections are given at four to six-week intervals for a further two to three years.</p>\n<p>Your allergist (allergy specialist) will decide how much venom is injected and how long the injections need to continue for. This will depend on your initial allergic reaction and your response to the treatment.</p>\n<p>For more information about immunotherapy, see&nbsp;<a>treating allergies</a>.</p>\n<h3>Ticks</h3>\n<p>If you\'ve been bitten by a tick, remove it as soon as possible to reduce the risk of getting a tick-borne infection, such as&nbsp;<a>Lyme disease</a>&nbsp;(a bacterial infection that causes a pink or red circular rash to develop around the area of the bite).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It\'s important that you remove the tick quickly and correctly by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>using a pair of fine-tipped tweezers or a tick removal tool (available from pet shops or veterinary surgeries)</li>\n<li>wearing gloves or using tissue over your fingers&nbsp;to avoid touching the tick</li>\n<li>grabbing the tick as close to the skin as possible</li>\n<li>gently but firmly pulling straight up until all of the tick\'s mouthparts have been removed</li>\n<li>not twisting or jerking the tick while&nbsp;removing it to avoid the mouthparts breaking off and remaining in the skin</li>\n<li>washing your hands with soap and water afterwards</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Don\'t use petroleum jelly, alcohol, a lit match or any other method to try to remove a&nbsp;tick. It won\'t work and could cause infection.</p>\n<p>After removing the tick, clean the bite with soap and water or an antiseptic, such as an iodine scrub.</p>\n<p>Avoid scratching the bite because it will cause further swelling and increase the risk of infection. Most tick bites will heal within three weeks.</p>\n<p>Seek medical attention if you\'ve&nbsp;been unable to remove all of the tick. You should also see your GP if you&nbsp;develop:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a pink or red rash</li>\n<li>a temperature of 38&deg;C (100.4&deg;F) or above</li>\n<li>other&nbsp;<a>flu-like symptoms</a>, such as a&nbsp;<a>headache</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;joint pain</li>\n<li>swollen lymph nodes</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(71,70,NULL,NULL,'<h1>Skin rashes in children:</h1>\n<h2>About skin rashes in children</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Childhood rashes are common and aren\'t usually a cause for concern.

Although meningitis has become less common over recent years, it\'s important to be aware of the rash and the other&nbsp;<a>signs and symptoms of meningitis</a>.</p>\n<h2 >Cellulitis</h2>\n<p><a>Cellulitis</a>&nbsp;is an infection of the deeper layers of skin and underlying tissue. The affected area will be red, painful, swollen and hot. It often affects the legs, but can occur anywhere on the body. Your child will probably also have a fever.</p>\n<p>See your GP immediately if an area of your child\'s skin suddenly turns red, hot and tender. If you can\'t see your GP on the same day, go to a walk-in centre or minor injuries unit.</p>\n<p>Cellulitis can usually be diagnosed by assessing the symptoms and examining the skin. It usually responds well to treatment with&nbsp;<a >antibiotics</a>.</p>\n<h2>Chickenpox</h2>\n<p><a>Chickenpox</a>&nbsp;is a viral illness that most children catch at some point. It most commonly affects children under 10 years of age.</p>\n<p>A rash of itchy spots turns into fluid-filled blisters.&nbsp;They crust over to form scabs, which after a while drop off. Some children only have a few spots, whereas others have them over their entire body.&nbsp;The spots are most likely to appear on the face, ears and scalp, under the arms, on the chest and belly, and on the arms and legs.</p>\n<p>There\'s no specific treatment for chickenpox, but you can take&nbsp;steps to relieve the symptoms. For example,&nbsp;<a>paracetamol</a>&nbsp;can&nbsp;help relieve fever (don\'t give aspirin to children under 16), and calamine lotion and cooling gels can be used to ease itching.</p>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;<a>treating chickenpox</a>.</p>\n<h2>Eczema</h2>\n<p>Eczema&nbsp;is a long-term condition that causes the skin to become itchy, red, dry and cracked. The most common type is&nbsp;<a>atopic eczema</a>, which mainly affects children but can continue into adulthood.</p>\n<p>Atopic eczema commonly develops behind the knees or on the elbows, neck, eyes and ears. It&nbsp;isn\'t a serious condition, but if your child later becomes infected with the&nbsp;<a>herpes simplex virus</a>, it can&nbsp;cause the eczema to flare up into an outbreak of tiny blisters called eczema herpeticum, and will cause a fever.</p>\n<p>About one in five children in the UK&nbsp;has eczema, and in eight out 10 cases it develops before the age of five, often before a child\'s first birthday.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Read about&nbsp;<a>treating atopic eczema</a>.</p>\n<h2>Erythema multiforme</h2>\n<p>Erythema multiforme&nbsp;is a skin rash&nbsp;(usually mild) that\'s caused by an allergic reaction to the&nbsp;<a>herpes simplex virus</a>.</p>\n<p>The spots look like targets, with a dark red centre and paler ring around the outside. The hands or feet tend to be affected first, followed by the limbs, upper body and face.</p>\n<p>Your child will probably feel unwell and may have a fever, which you should be able to treat with over-the-counter medicine. It may take&nbsp;from two&nbsp;to six weeks before they feel better.&nbsp;See your GP if your child has a rash and seems unwell.</p>\n<p>In rare cases, erythema multiforme can be triggered by a reaction to certain medications, such as an antibiotic or anticonvulsant. This more severe form is called Stevens-Johnson syndrome and it can be&nbsp;life-threatening.</p>\n<h2>Hand, foot and mouth disease</h2>\n<p><a>Hand, foot and mouth disease</a>&nbsp;is a common, contagious infection that causes&nbsp;<a>mouth ulcers</a>&nbsp;and spots and blisters on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.</p>\n<p>It\'s most common in young children (particularly those under 10), but it can also affect older children and adults.</p>\n<p>There\'s no cure for hand, foot and mouth disease&nbsp;and&nbsp;it\'s easily spread, so you should keep your child away from school or nursery until they\'re better. Your child\'s immune system will fight the virus and it should clear up after about seven to 10 days.</p>\n<p>Make sure your child drinks plenty of fluid, and&nbsp;if eating and swallowing is uncomfortable, give them soft foods, such as mashed potatoes, yoghurt and soup.</p>\n<h2 >Impetigo</h2>\n<p><a >Impetigo</a>&nbsp;is a common and highly contagious skin infection that causes sores and blisters. It isn\'t usually serious and often improves within a week of treatment. There are two types of impetigo&nbsp;&ndash; bullous and non-bullous.</p>\n<p>Bullous impetigo typically affects the trunk (the area of the body between the waist and neck), and causes fluid-filled blisters that burst after a few days to leave a yellow crust.</p>\n<p>Non-bullous impetigo typically affects the skin around the nose and mouth, causing sores that quickly burst to leave a yellow-brown crust.</p>\n<p>See your GP if you think your child has impetigo.&nbsp;<a>Antibiotics</a>, in the form of a cream or tablets, will be prescribed. This should reduce the length of the illness to around seven to 10 days.</p>\n<h2 >Keratosis pilaris (\"chicken skin\")</h2>\n<p>Keratosis pilaris&nbsp;is a common and harmless skin condition. The skin on the back of the upper arms becomes rough and bumpy, as if covered in permanent goose pimples. Sometimes, the buttocks, thighs, forearms and upper back can also be affected.</p>\n<p>Keratosis pilaris typically begins in childhood and gets worse during puberty. Some people find it improves after this and may even disappear in adulthood.</p>\n<p>There\'s no cure for keratosis pilaris,&nbsp;and it often gets better on its own without treatment. However, there are some measures you can take that may improve your child\'s rash, such as using non-soap cleansers rather than soap, and&nbsp;an emollient to moisturise their skin. Your GP or pharmacist will be able to recommend a suitable cream.</p>\n<h2>Measles</h2>\n<p><a>Measles</a>&nbsp;is a highly infectious illness that most commonly affects young children. It\'s now rare in the UK because of the effectiveness of&nbsp;the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.</p>\n<p>The measles rash is red-brown blotches. It usually starts on the head or upper neck and then spreads outwards to the rest of the body. Your child may also have a fever and&nbsp;<a>cold-like symptoms</a>.</p>\n<p>Call your GP surgery immediately if you think your child has measles. It\'s best to phone before visiting because the surgery may need to make arrangements to reduce the risk of spreading the infection to others.</p>\n<p>Measles usually passes in about seven to 10 days without causing further problems.&nbsp;<a>Paracetamol</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>ibuprofen</a>&nbsp;can be used to relieve fever, aches and pains (don\'t give aspirin to children under 16). Also, make sure your child drinks plenty of water to avoid&nbsp;<a>dehydration</a>.</p>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;<a>treating measles</a>.</p>\n<h2>Molluscum contagiosum</h2>\n<p>Molluscum contagiosum&nbsp;is a viral skin infection that causes clusters of&nbsp;small, firm, raised spots to develop on the skin.</p>\n<p>It commonly affects young children aged one to five years, who tend to catch it after close physical contact with another infected child.</p>\n<p>The condition is usually painless, although some children may experience some itchiness. It usually goes away within 18 months without the need for treatment.</p>\n<p>Molluscum contagiosum is highly infectious. However, most adults are resistant to the virus, which means they\'re unlikely to&nbsp;catch it if they come into contact with it.</p>\n<h2>Pityriasis rosea</h2>\n<p>Pityriasis rosea&nbsp;is a relatively common skin condition that causes&nbsp;a temporary rash of raised, red scaly patches to develop on the body.&nbsp;Most cases occur in older children and young adults (aged between 10 and 35).</p>\n<p>The rash can be very itchy. In most cases,&nbsp;it clears up without treatment in&nbsp;2 to 12 weeks, although in&nbsp;rare cases it can last up to five months.</p>\n<p>Emollients,&nbsp;<a>steroid creams</a>&nbsp;and antihistamines can be used to help relieve the itchiness. The rash doesn\'t usually leave scars, although the skin can sometimes be discoloured afterwards.</p>\n<h2>Prickly heat (heat rash)</h2>\n<p>Prickly heat (heat rash), also known as miliaria,&nbsp;is an itchy rash of small, raised red spots that causes a stinging or prickly sensation on the skin.</p>\n<p>It occurs when the sweat ducts in the outer layer of skin (epidermis)&nbsp;are obstructed. You can get a heat rash anywhere on your body, but the face, neck, back, chest or thighs are most often affected.</p>\n<p>Infants can sometimes get a prickly heat rash if they sweat more than usual&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;for example, when it\'s hot and humid or if they\'re overdressed. It isn\'t a serious condition and rarely requires any specific treatment.</p>\n<h2>Psoriasis</h2>\n<p><a>Psoriasis</a>&nbsp;is a long-lasting (chronic) skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales.</p>\n<p>The severity of psoriasis varies greatly from person to person.&nbsp;For some people, it\'s just a minor irritation, but for others it can have&nbsp;a major impact on their quality of life.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There\'s no cure for psoriasis, but there are a number of treatments that can help improve the symptoms and appearance of skin patches. For example,&nbsp;<a>topical corticosteroids</a>&nbsp;are creams and ointments that can be applied to the skin.</p>\n<h2 >Ringworm</h2>\n<p><a>Ringworm</a>&nbsp;is a highly infectious fungal skin infection that causes a ring-like red or silvery patch on the skin that can be scaly, inflamed or itchy.</p>\n<p>Ringworm often affects the arms and legs, but it can appear almost anywhere on&nbsp;the body. Other similar fungal infections can affect the scalp, feet, groin and nails.</p>\n<p>Ringworm can usually be easily treated with antifungal medicines, which&nbsp;are&nbsp;available from a pharmacy.&nbsp;Ringworm of the scalp can cause scaling and patches of hair loss. It\'s treated with antifungal tablets, often combined with antifungal shampoo.</p>\n<h2>Scabies</h2>\n<p><a>Scabies</a>&nbsp;is a contagious skin condition that\'s intensely itchy. It\'s caused by tiny mites that burrow into the skin.</p>\n<p>In children, scabies is usually spread through prolonged periods of skin-to-skin contact with an infected adult or child &ndash; for example, during play fighting or hugging.</p>\n<p>The mites like warm places, such as skin folds, between the fingers, under fingernails, or around the buttock creases. They leave small red blotches, which are often found on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet. In infants, blisters are commonly found on the soles of the feet.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See your GP if you think your child has scabies. It\'s not usually a serious condition, but it does need to be treated. Your GP will prescribe a lotion or cream. Read more about&nbsp;<a>treating scabies</a>.</p>\n<h2>Scarlet fever</h2>\n<p><a>Scarlet fever</a>&nbsp;is a highly contagious bacterial infection that usually affects children between two and eight years of age. It causes a distinctive pink-red rash, which feels like sandpaper to touch and may be itchy.</p>\n<p>It often starts with a&nbsp;<a>sore throat</a>, fever and&nbsp;<a>headache</a>, with the rash developing two to five days after infection. The rash usually occurs on the chest and stomach before spreading to other areas of the body, such as the ears and neck.</p>\n<p>Scarlet fever usually clears up after about a week, but see your GP if you think your child may have it.&nbsp;<a>Antibiotics</a>&nbsp;are used to treat it (liquid antibiotics, such as penicillin or amoxicillin, are often used to treat children).</p>\n<h2>Slapped cheek syndrome</h2>\n<p><a>Slapped cheek syndrome</a>&nbsp;&ndash; also known as fifth disease or parvovirus B19&nbsp;&ndash; is a viral infection that\'s common in children aged six to 10.</p>\n<p>It causes a distinctive bright red rash to develop on both cheeks. This can look alarming, but it usually clears up by itself in one to three weeks.</p>\n<p>Unless your child is feeling unwell, they don\'t need to stay away from school. Once the rash appears, the infection is no longer contagious. However, it\'s a good idea to notify your child\'s school about the infection.</p>\n<h2>Urticaria (hives)</h2>\n<p><a>Urticaria</a>&nbsp;&ndash; also known as hives, weals, welts or nettle rash &ndash; is a raised, itchy rash that can affect one part of the body or be spread across large areas.&nbsp;It\'s&nbsp;a common skin reaction that often affects children.</p>\n<p>Urticaria occurs when a trigger causes high levels of histamine and other chemical messengers to be released in the skin. These substances cause the blood vessels in the skin to open up, resulting in&nbsp;redness or pinkness, and swelling and itchiness.</p>\n<p>There are many possible triggers of urticaria, including allergens, such as food or latex, irritants, such as nettles, medicines, and physical factors, such as heat or exercise. Sometimes, a cause can\'t be identified.</p>\n</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(72,71,NULL,NULL,'<h1>Sunburn</h1> <div> <div> <h2>About sunburn</h2> <div> <p>Sunburn is skin damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) rays.

They should get better on their own or with help from your midwife, GP or pharmacist. Every woman\'s experience is different.</p> <h2>When to get medical help</h2> <p>Phone your local maternity unit or the NHS 24 111 service immediately if you:</p> <ul> <li>have bleeding from your vagina</li> <li>have discharge from your vagina such as watery, clear or coloured discharge</li> <li>have vision issues (such as blurred vision and flashing lights) or a severe headache</li> <li>have severely swollen hands, ankles and face, feeling sick or being sick</li> <li>have constant pain in the upper part of your abdomen</li> <li>have chest pain or breathing issues</li> <li>feel very unwell</li> <li>think you&rsquo;ve noticed changes in your baby&rsquo;s movements</li> </ul> <p>These could be a sign of serious health issues for you or your baby.</p> <h2>Backache</h2> <p>As your baby grows there&rsquo;s more strain on your pelvis and spine. This can give you backache, which can get worse as your pregnancy progresses.</p> <h3>Managing backaches</h3> <p>If you have backache:</p> <ul> <li>do some gentle exercises</li> <li>take care when you&rsquo;re lifting</li> <li>wear flat shoes or shoes with a low heel</li> <li>try sitting and standing with your back straight and shoulders relaxed</li> <li>bend your knees when lifting lighter things and ask someone else to lift heavy things for you</li> </ul> <h2>Morning sickness</h2> <p>Around 4 in 5 women feel sick or are sick (vomit) at some point in their pregnancy.</p> <p>Morning sickness usually:</p> <ul> <li>starts between the 4th and 17th week</li> <li>is at its worst around week 9</li> <li>stops by the 20th week</li> </ul> <h3>Managing morning sickness</h3> <p>Sickness can normally be managed by taking care about what and when you eat, and making sure you have plenty of fluids.</p> <p>You can get antacids from your pharmacist or your GP can prescribe anti-sickness tablets if you need them. Severe symptoms may need to be managed by an obstetrician.</p> <h3>Severe morning sickness</h3> <p>About 3 in 100 women get severe morning sickness.</p> <p>It can happen for different reasons, including:</p> <ul> <li>sensitivity to changes in hormones</li> <li>having a multiple pregnancy</li> </ul> <p>Sometimes morning sickness can be so bad that you may not be able to keep any food or fluids down.</p> <p>If this happens you may need to have fluids given via a drip in your arm, which may mean a stay in hospital.</p> <h2>Constipation</h2> <p>Constipation is when your bowels don&rsquo;t move as often as usual.</p> <p>Your stools might be hard, lumpy and unusually large or small. It can sometimes be uncomfortable or painful too.</p> <p>Changes to your hormones can cause constipation.</p> <h3>Managing constipation</h3> <p>You can prevent it or ease the symptoms by:</p> <ul> <li>eating high-fibre food, such as vegetables, fruit, beans and wholegrain bread.</li> <li>drinking at least 2 litres of water a day</li> <li>being active, taking a walk every day or swimming</li> <li>speaking to your midwife, pharmacist or GP if these things aren&rsquo;t working</li> </ul> <p>Constipation medicine is available and safe to use during pregnancy which may help.</p> <h2>Cystitis</h2> <p>Cystitis is an inflammation in your bladder.

This can lead to urine infections, which can be more common when you&rsquo;re pregnant.</p> <p>If you\'re feeling uncomfortable, don\'t wait to see if it becomes an infection, go to your GP. You may be given antibiotics to take.</p> <h2>Heartburn</h2> <p>Heartburn or indigestion is a burning feeling around the middle part of the top of your chest (behind your breastbone).</p> <p>It&rsquo;s caused by stomach acid rising into the tube joining your mouth.</p> <p>You&rsquo;re more likely to get heartburn later in your pregnancy as your baby presses on your stomach.</p> <h3>Managing heartburn</h3> <p>To ease the symptoms of heartburn, try to:</p> <ul> <li>eat little and often and slowly</li> <li>take antacids for heartburn, but speak to your midwife or pharmacist for advice before taking anything</li> </ul> <p>Heartburn can be made worse by:</p> <ul> <li>drinking strong tea or coffee, or pure fruit juice</li> <li>eating spicy and fatty foods</li> </ul> <h2>Piles</h2> <p>Piles or haemorrhoids are swelling inside or around your anus (back passage).</p> <p>If the blood vessels inside the swellings are large they can cause:</p> <ul> <li>itching</li> <li>a burning sensation</li> <li>bleeding when you go to the toilet</li> </ul> <p>They&rsquo;re common in later pregnancy and can get worse if you&rsquo;re constipated.</p> <h3>Managing piles</h3> <p>Laxitives, ointments and medicines can ease discomfort, pain and bleeding.</p> <p>Your midwife, pharmacist or GP can advise how to prevent and treat piles.</p> <h2>Pelvic girdle pain</h2> <p>Pelvic girdle pain develops when the muscles, ligaments and the small joint at the front of your pelvis stretch. This can cause a lot of pain in your pelvis and back.</p> <p>Around 1 in 5 pregnant women have pelvic girdle pain.</p> <p>Contact your local obstetric physiotherapist for advice.</p> <h2>Swelling</h2> <p>Swelling happens when your body holds on to more fluid than usual. This is called oedema.</p> <p>Swelling can:</p> <ul> <li>be uncomfortable and interfere with daily life</li> <li>affect different parts of your body in different ways</li> </ul> <p>Swelling can also be a sign that something more serious is wrong:</p> <ul> <li>Swollen and uncomfortable legs are common when you&rsquo;re pregnant, but can be a sign of deep vein thrombosis</li> <li>Very swollen ankles, fingers, hands or face can be a sign of pre-eclampsia - if this happens, contact your midwife or GP immediately</li> </ul> <p>It\'s normal to have some swelling, especially later in your pregnancy. This is usually temporary and settles after your baby\'s born. It\'s common for women to feel puffiness in their ankles and fingers, but if your face is swelling too, tell your midwife, GP or the hospital.</p> <h3>Managing swelling in your feet</h3> <p>You may need a larger shoe size if your feet swell up. Choose supportive footwear with:</p> <ul> <li>a low or flat heel</li> <li>sock absorption</li> <li>a fastening to keep them firmly on your feet</li> </ul> <h3>Managing swelling in your ankles</h3> <p>Swelling in your ankles tends to get worse as the day goes on.</p> <p>Your midwife will probably advise you to rest with your feet up on a chair, sofa or bed.</p> <h3>Managing swelling in your wrists</h3> <p>Swelling in your wrists can cause a painful or tingling sensation in your fingers called carpal tunnel syndrome.</p> <p>Your midwife may recommend hand exercises or a splint, or you may need a steroid injection.</p> <h2>Varicose veins</h2> <p>Varicose veins are unusually large blood vessels under the skin that stick out more than usual.</p> <p>Varicose veins:</p> <ul> <li>usually develop in your legs, but you can get them in the opening to your vagina too</li> <li>can be painful and sometimes itchy</li> </ul> <p>Always tell your midwife or GP if you notice any hot, red or painful areas in your legs or vulva.</p> <h3>Managing varicose veins</h3> <p>To ease discomfort:</p> <ul> <li>wear support tights</li> <li>try to rest with your legs up when you can</li> <li>don&rsquo;t stand for long periods</li> </ul> <p>Special exercises can help too. Ask your midwife, antenatal teacher or an obstetric physiotherapist to show you what to do</p> <h2>Anaemia</h2> <p>Anaemia is when there\'s not enough red blood cells in your body, and less haemoglobin than normal in each red blood cell.

Going through labour and giving birth is the safest option for most women, even though it can be very distressing.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s natural to want to know why this happened. It&rsquo;s not always possible to know why your baby died and that can be hard to come to terms with.</p>\n<p>Your midwife and obstetrician will be there to support you through it.

You might want to involve other members of your family too.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re worried about what your baby looks like, your midwife or doctor can describe them to help you decide. Many parents find it comforting to see, touch and hold their baby and, if you want to, you can bath and dress them.</p>\n<h3>Cuddle cot</h3>\n<p>Your midwife can talk to you about a Cuddle Cot, a special cooling mattress inside a cot which can let you spend more time with your baby in the hospital or at home.</p>\n<p>This gives you more time to say goodbye, with the support of family and friends.</p>\n<p>If the hospital doesn&rsquo;t have a Cuddle Cot then there are other organisations that can organise one for bereaved parents. Ask your midwife.</p>\n<h2>After a stillbirth</h2>\n<p>What you choose to do is very personal and individual, as is the way you grieve.</p>\n<p>Specialist help and support is available for parents and families who have lost a baby and your midwife, family nurse and health visitor can help you to find the right support locally.</p>\n<h3>Registering a stillbirth</h3>\n<p>Your baby&rsquo;s stillbirth must be registered. Your midwife and the hospital staff can advise you how to do this.</p>\n<p>You can&rsquo;t officially register a baby lost before 24 weeks of pregnancy, but some hospitals will give you a certificate in memory of your baby if you ask.</p>\n<h3>Funeral arrangements</h3>\n<p>You&rsquo;ll need time to think what you&rsquo;d like for your baby&rsquo;s funeral. This could be a burial or cremation with a service in the style of your choice. Take as much time as you need to decide on the right way to say goodbye.</p>\n<p>All hospitals in Scotland will offer a funeral service for your baby free of charge or you may choose to make your own private arrangements, which can give you more choice and control.</p>\n<h3>Coping with the loss of a baby</h3>\n<p>Everyone reacts differently to the loss of a baby. Your emotions might be overwhelming and you might feel physically drained too.</p>\n<p>Take time to rest and look after yourself. It&rsquo;s important to know you are not alone and have done nothing wrong.</p>\n<h3>Post-mortem</h3>\n<p>If you lost your baby after 13 weeks, you\'ll be offered a post-mortem (autopsy). This is a medical investigation to try to understand what happened and find out if there are issues that could affect a future pregnancy</p>\n<p>Whether or not to have a post-mortem can be a difficult decision and you&rsquo;ll be given support and time to think it over. If you have questions or worries, ask the person who discusses the post-mortem with you.</p>\n<h2>Recovering from a stillbirth</h2>\n<p>You will need care from your midwife and doctor to make sure your body is recovering. Your midwife will assist you through all the decisions you need to make and help you to find the right support.</p>\n<p>You don&rsquo;t have to manage alone and it can sometimes help to talk with others who have been through baby loss. You, your baby&rsquo;s father or your partner and your family are likely to need time to grieve.</p>\n<h3>Remembering your baby</h3>\n<p>Some parents find it helps to do something to remember their baby, like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>creating a space in their garden</li>\n<li>saying a prayer</li>\n<li>writing a poem</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Others keep photographs, handprints or footprints, or locks of their baby\'s hair in a memory box. No matter what stage of pregnancy your loss is, you can make a memory box &ndash; ask your midwife about this. Some hospitals give special boxes to parents just for this.</p>\n<p>Some parents don&rsquo;t want to do any of these things, and that&rsquo;s okay too. There&rsquo;s no right or wrong way.</p>\n</div>\n</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(78,77,NULL,NULL,'<h1>Miscarriage</h1>\n<div >\n<div>\n<p>A miscarriage is the loss of your baby before 24 weeks. Early miscarriages happen in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Late miscarriages happen between 12 and 24 weeks.</p>\n<p>Most of the time there&rsquo;s no clear reason why it happens, but it&rsquo;s very unlikely to be caused by anything you did or didn&rsquo;t do.</p>\n<p>About 1 out of 5 pregnancies miscarry. Since many miscarriages aren\'t recorded the figure might be higher.</p>\n<h2>When to get medical help</h2>\n<p>Always get medical help if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you\'re bleeding from your vagina</li>\n<li>you\'ve got strong, cramping pain</li>\n<li>your waters break</li>\n<li>your baby\'s movements have changed, or you haven\'t felt them move for a while</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you\'re registered, contact your midwife or local maternity unit. If you&rsquo;re not registered, contact your GP or the NHS 24 111 service.</p>\n<h2>What causes a miscarriage?</h2>\n<p>Doctors think most miscarriages are caused when the building blocks controlling the development of a baby (the chromosomes) aren&rsquo;t right. Babies with too many or not enough chromosomes won\'t develop properly. This leads to a miscarriage.</p>\n<p>Miscarriages can also be caused by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>issues with your placenta</li>\n<li>cervical weakness - when your cervix (neck of your womb) starts to open</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Early miscarriages</h2>\n<p>An early miscarriage happens in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Most women who miscarry do so in the first 12 weeks of their pregnancy.</p>\n<p>Many women have a miscarriage before they even know they&rsquo;re pregnant. If this happens it can feel like a late period with heavy bleeding.</p>\n<h3>Symptoms of an early miscarriage</h3>\n<p>You might be having an early miscarriage if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you\'re bleeding from your vagina</li>\n<li>you\'ve cramps in your lower abdomen &ndash; these can feel like bad period pains</li>\n<li>there\'s fluid or tissue coming from your vagina</li>\n<li>your breasts are no longer tender and any morning sickness has passed</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bleeding</h3>\n<p>Having some light bleeding\'s fairly common in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy and doesn\'t necessarily mean you\'re having a miscarriage.</p>\n<p>If you start bleeding, you should always contact your GP or midwife and get advice about what to do.</p>\n<h3>What happens during an early miscarriage</h3>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re in the early weeks of pregnancy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you&rsquo;ll probably be asked to go to the early pregnancy unit at your local hospital straight away</li>\n<li>you&rsquo;ll have some tests and usually an ultrasound scan</li>\n<li>your body usually completes the miscarriage naturally</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending on your stage of pregnancy, you may deliver a small baby. That can be a shock and is an understandably upsetting time.</p>\n<h2>Late miscarriages</h2>\n<p>A late miscarriage happens after 12 weeks and before 24 weeks.</p>\n<p>For many parents who lose their baby after a late miscarriage, the word &lsquo;miscarriage&rsquo; doesn\'t properly express the impact of their loss. The loss of a baby at any time\'s a terrible shock and a late miscarriage can be especially hard.</p>\n<h3>Symptoms of a late miscarriage</h3>\n<p>You might be having a late miscarriage if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you\'re bleeding from your vagina &ndash; this can be heavy and you might have blood clots</li>\n<li>you\'ve strong, cramping pains</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Always get medical help if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you\'re bleeding</li>\n<li>your baby&rsquo;s movements have changed or you haven&rsquo;t felt any movements for a while.</li>\n<li>your waters break and your baby\'s born very quickly</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Contact your midwife or local maternity unit if you&rsquo;re registered with them. If you&rsquo;re not registered, contact your GP or phone the NHS 24 111 service.</p>\n<h3>What happens during a late miscarriage</h3>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re later on in pregnancy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you may be asked to go to the maternity ward</li>\n<li>you&rsquo;ll have some tests and usually an ultrasound scan</li>\n<li>you\'re likely to go through labour in hospital and might have your labour induced</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While you deliver your baby you\'re likely to have heavier bleeding and labour-like pains.</p>\n<h2>Making difficult decisions</h2>\n<p>If you\'re having a miscarriage, your doctor or midwife will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>talk to you about what will happen next</li>\n<li>help you, and your partner if you have one, decide what you&rsquo;d like to do</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may have many difficult decisions to make at this time and will have overwhelming emotions. Take your time. Your midwife or doctor can help, and there are many organisations that can support you, your baby&rsquo;s father and your family.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>After a miscarriage</h2>\n<p>Depending on your circumstances and stage of pregnancy, your midwife or doctor may ask if you\'d like to see or hold your baby.</p>\n<p>Some parents decide they don\'t want to see their baby, and others choose not to for faith or cultural reasons. This is a decision only you can make. It can be very hard when you\'re feeling overwhelmed. Whatever you decide is okay.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re worried about what your baby looks like, your midwife or doctor can describe them to help you decide.</p>\n<h3>If your symptoms continue</h3>\n<p>You&rsquo;ll probably have some bleeding for a week or two. If you continue to have symptoms after your miscarriage, it may mean that some of the pregnancy tissue\'s still in your womb.</p>\n<p>Some women may need medicine or a short operation to treat this.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re worried about seeking treatment, maybe a friend can come with you. Having support\'s really important at this difficult time.</p>\n<h3>Taking time off work</h3>\n<p>Many women will want to take time off work after having a miscarriage.</p>\n<p>If you have a miscarriage before the end of the 24th week, you&rsquo;re entitled to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>take sick leave</li>\n<li>any sick pay you\'d normally qualify for</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you lose your baby after the end of the 24th week, you&rsquo;re entitled to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>take maternity leave</li>\n<li>any maternity pay you qualify for</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Speak to your employer about which choices may be right for you and your family.</p>\n<p>Working Families has more about&nbsp;<a>your rights at work after a miscarriage</a></p>\n<h2>Repeated miscarriages</h2>\n<p>Most women go on to have a successful pregnancy and a healthy baby after a miscarriage. But unfortunately, some women have repeated miscarriages.</p>\n<p>If you\'ve had:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 or 2 miscarriages - you\'re not more likely than anyone else to have another one</li>\n<li>3 or more miscarriages - your GP can refer you to a specialist to see whether there&rsquo;s a specific cause</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(79,78,NULL,NULL,'<h1>Ectopic pregnancy</h1>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>An ectopic pregnancy is when a fertilised egg develops outside the womb.</p>\n<p>This usually happens in one of the fallopian tubes which lead from your ovaries to your womb.

You can have an allergy to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>tree pollen, released during spring</li>\n<li>grass pollen, released during the end of spring and beginning of summer</li>\n<li>weed pollen, released any time from early spring to late autumn</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It\'s highly likely that the pollen will also cause other symptoms, such as sneezing and&nbsp;a runny or blocked nose.</p>\n<p>Allergies to dust mites or animal fur cause symptoms throughout the year. Both eyes are usually affected and you may find the symptoms worse in the morning.</p>\n<p>Some people develop an allergy to eye drops. This is known as contact dermatoconjunctivitis and it can also affect your eyelids, causing them to become dry and sore.</p>\n<p>Some people are allergic to wearing contact lenses, which is known as giant papillary conjunctivitis. The symptoms progress much more slowly and you may also develop small spots on the inside of your upper eyelids.&nbsp;This type of conjunctivitis carries a high risk of complications, so you need to seek medical advice as soon as possible</p>\n<h2>When to seek medical advice</h2>\n<p>Most cases of conjunctivitis aren\'t a cause for concern, but you should contact your GP if you think you have it, particularly if you think it\'s related to wearing contact lenses.</p>\n<p>Your GP can check whether there\'s a more serious underlying cause of your symptoms.</p>\n<h2>When to seek immediate medical advice</h2>\n<p>The following symptoms could be the sign of a more serious eye condition:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>pain in your eyes</li>\n<li>sensitivity to light (photophobia)</li>\n<li>disturbed vision</li>\n<li>intense redness in one eye or both eyes</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Causes of conjunctivitis</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Conjunctivitis is a condition that occurs when the conjunctiva (a thin layer of cells covering the front of your eyes) becomes inflamed.</p>\n<p>The three most common causes of this inflammation are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>infection (infective conjunctivitis)</li>\n<li>an allergic reaction (allergic conjunctivitis)</li>\n<li>something irritating the conjunctiva, such as a loose eyelash (irritant conjunctivitis)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are&nbsp;discussed in more detail below.</p>\n<h2>Infective conjunctivitis</h2>\n<p>Eye infections are most commonly caused by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>bacteria&nbsp;&ndash; for example, the strains of bacteria that&nbsp;often cause lung and ear infections</li>\n<li>a virus&nbsp;&ndash; most commonly an adenovirus that may also cause a&nbsp;<a>sore throat</a>&nbsp;and high temperature (fever)</li>\n<li><a>sexually transmitted infections (STIs)</a>&nbsp;&ndash; such as&nbsp;chlamydia or gonorrhoea</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Viral conjunctivitis causes a watery discharge, while the discharge from bacterial conjunctivitis contains pus. An eye swab&nbsp;can also determine the cause of the infection (read more about&nbsp;<a>diagnosing conjunctivitis</a>).</p>\n<h3>Spreading the infection</h3>\n<p>You\'re more likely to develop infective conjunctivitis if you\'ve been in close contact with someone who\'s already infected with it.</p>\n<p>It\'s therefore very important to wash your hands thoroughly after coming into contact with anyone who has infective conjunctivitis. You should also avoid sharing pillows or towels with anyone with the infection.</p>\n<h3>Risk groups</h3>\n<p>You may be more at risk of getting infective conjunctivitis if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you\'re old or young &ndash; it\'s more common in children and the elderly, possibly because children come into contact with more infections at school, and elderly people may have a weaker immune system</li>\n<li>you\'ve recently had an upper respiratory tract infection &ndash; such as a&nbsp;<a>cold</a></li>\n<li>you have&nbsp;<a>diabetes</a>&nbsp;or another condition that weakens your immune system &ndash; as you may be more vulnerable to infections</li>\n<li>you\'re taking&nbsp;<a>corticosteroids (steroids)</a>&nbsp;&ndash; which can weaken your immune system</li>\n<li>you have blepharitis (inflammation of the rims of the eyelids)&nbsp;&ndash; which can be caused by a bacterial infection and may lead to conjunctivitis</li>\n<li>you\'ve been in a crowded place &ndash; such as a busy train</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Allergic conjunctivitis</h2>\n<p>Allergic conjunctivitis is caused when your eyes come into contact with an allergen (a particular substance that causes your immune system to react abnormally). This is known as an allergic reaction.</p>\n<p>There are four main types of allergic conjunctivitis:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>seasonal allergic conjunctivitis</li>\n<li>perennial allergic conjunctivitis</li>\n<li>contact dermatoconjunctivitis</li>\n<li>giant papillary conjunctivitis</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Seasonal and perennial conjunctivitis</h3>\n<p>Seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis are usually caused by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>pollen from grass, trees or flowers</li>\n<li>dust mites</li>\n<li>flakes of dead animal skin</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These types of conjunctivitis are more common in people who also have other allergies, such as&nbsp;<a>asthma</a>,&nbsp;and often occur with&nbsp;allergic rhinitis.</p>\n<h3>Contact dermatoconjunctivitis</h3>\n<p>Contact dermatoconjunctivitis is&nbsp;usually caused by eye drops, but it can also be caused by make-up or chemicals.</p>\n<h3>Giant papillary conjunctivitis</h3>\n<p>Giant papillary conjunctivitis is caused by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>contact lenses</li>\n<li>stitches used in eye surgery</li>\n<li>a prostheses (artificial) part of the eye that\'s fitted during eye surgery</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Giant papillary conjunctivitis is estimated to affect around 1-5% of people who use soft contact lenses and 1% of people who use hard contact lenses.</p>\n<h2>Irritant conjunctivitis</h2>\n<p>Irritant conjunctivitis can have a wide range of potential causes. Some common causes include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>chlorinated water used in swimming pools&nbsp;</li>\n<li>shampoo</li>\n<li>a stray eyelash rubbing against the conjunctiva</li>\n<li>smoke or fumes</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Diagnosing conjunctivitis</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Your GP should be able to diagnose conjunctivitis by asking about your symptoms and examining your eyes.</p>\n<p>Describing how your conjunctivitis started can help your GP diagnose which type it is and decide whether it needs to be treated.</p>\n<p>The most common symptoms of infective conjunctivitis are sticky, red and watery eyes. However, infective conjunctivitis can sometimes be confused with other types of conjunctivitis, which are treated differently.</p>\n<h2>Swab test</h2>\n<p>Your GP may suggest further tests, such as a swab test, if your conjunctivitis hasn\'t responded to treatment, or to help decide what treatment to use. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>A swab looks similar to a cotton bud. It\'s used to collect a small sample of mucus from your infected eye, which is sent to&nbsp;a laboratory to find out the cause of your conjunctivitis.</p>\n<p>If your symptoms are severe or don\'t respond to treatment, you may need to see an eye specialist (ophthalmologist).</p>\n<h2>Other conditions</h2>\n<p>Most cases of&nbsp;conjunctivitis clear up within&nbsp;one to&nbsp;two&nbsp;weeks without needing any medical treatment. In some cases, it can last for longer than two weeks, which is known as persistent infective conjunctivitis.</p>\n<p>If you have any unusual symptoms, such as severe pain, blurred vision or sensitivity to light, it may mean that you have a more serious condition.</p>\n<p>If you have any of these symptoms, it\'s very important to seek medical assistance immediately, either by contacting your GP or going to your nearest hospital.</p>\n<p>Other more serious&nbsp;conditions include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>acute glaucoma &ndash;&nbsp;a rare form of glaucoma that causes a painful build-up of pressure in your eye</li>\n<li>keratitis &ndash; where the cornea (the clear layer at the front of your eye) becomes swollen and develops open sores</li>\n<li>iritis &ndash;&nbsp;a type of&nbsp;uveitis (swelling of the middle layer of your eye) that causes pain,&nbsp;<a>headaches</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;watery eyes</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Newborn babies</h2>\n<p>Contact your GP straight away if you think your baby may have infective conjunctivitis (also called neonatal conjunctivitis).</p>\n<p>If this isn\'t possible, call&nbsp;NHS 24\'s \'<a href=\"tel:111\">111</a>\' service&nbsp;or your local out-of-hours service. Your GP will examine your baby closely to see if they have sticky eyes or infective conjunctivitis.</p>\n<p>All newborn babies with infective conjunctivitis must be referred to an eye specialist straight away for treatment.</p>\n<h2>Treating conjunctivitis</h2>\n<div class=\"editor\">\n<p>The recommended treatment for conjunctivitis will depend on whether it\'s caused by infection, an allergic reaction or an irritant, such as a stray eyelash.</p>\n<p>Each treatment option is discussed in more detail below.</p>\n<h2>Infective conjunctivitis</h2>\n<p>Most cases of infective conjunctivitis don\'t need medical treatment and clear up in one to two weeks.</p>\n<h3>Self care</h3>\n<p>There are several ways you can treat infective conjunctivitis at home. The advice below&nbsp;should help ease your symptoms.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove your contact lenses&nbsp;&ndash; if you wear contact lenses, take them out until all the symptoms of the infection have gone; don\'t re-use old lenses after the infection has gone because they could be a potential source of re-infection; always use new lenses, solutions and cases after an infection.</li>\n<li>Use lubricant eye drops &ndash; these are available over the counter at pharmacies or they may be prescribed for you; they may help ease any soreness and stickiness in your eyes; always follow the manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions.</li>\n<li>Gently clean away sticky discharge from your eyelids and lashes using cotton wool soaked in water.</li>\n<li>Wash your hands regularly &ndash; this is particularly important after touching your eyes and will stop the infection spreading to others.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Antibiotics</h3>\n<p><a>Antibiotics</a>&nbsp;aren\'t usually prescribed for infective conjunctivitis because it usually clears up by itself and there\'s a very low risk of complications for untreated conjunctivitis.</p>\n<p>However, if the infection is particularly severe or it has lasted for more than two weeks, you may be prescribed antibiotics. Some schools or playgroups may insist that a child is treated with antibiotics before they can return, although this is rare.</p>\n<p>Chloramphenicol and&nbsp;fusidic acid are the two main types of antibiotics that may be prescribed.</p>\n<h3>Chloramphenicol</h3>\n<p>Chloramphenicol is usually the first choice of antibiotic and comes in the form of eye drops. It\'s available without a prescription from pharmacies to treat bacterial conjunctivitis.</p>\n<p>Chloramphenicol needs to be used carefully to get the best results, so make sure you follow the advice of your pharmacist about how and when to use it, or check the patient information leaflet that comes with the medication so you know how to use it properly.</p>\n<p>If eye drops aren\'t suitable for you, you may be prescribed the antibiotic as an eye ointment instead.</p>\n<h3>Fusidic acid</h3>\n<p>Fusidic acid&nbsp;may be prescribed if chloramphenicol isn\'t suitable for you. It\'s often better for children and elderly people because it doesn\'t need to be used as often. It\'s also the preferred treatment for pregnant women.</p>\n<p>Like&nbsp;chloramphenicol, fusidic acid comes in the form of eye drops and should be used as advised by your doctor or as described in the instructions that come with the medication.</p>\n<h3>Side effects</h3>\n<p>Eye drops can briefly cause&nbsp;blurred&nbsp;vision. Avoid driving or operating machinery straight after using eye drops.</p>\n<p>Chloramphenicol and fusidic acid can also cause other side effects, such as a slight stinging or burning sensation in your eye, although this shouldn\'t last long.</p>\n<h3>Further treatment</h3>\n<p>It\'s very important to go back&nbsp;to your GP if you still have symptoms after two weeks. You should also contact your GP immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>eye pain</li>\n<li>sensitivity to light (photophobia)</li>\n<li>loss of vision</li>\n<li>intense redness in one eye or both eyes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your GP may recommend that you\'re tested for&nbsp;<a>sexually transmitted infections (STIs)</a>. Some STIs, such as chlamydia, can cause infective conjunctivitis. If this is the case, your symptoms may last for several months.</p>\n<h2>Allergic conjunctivitis</h2>\n<p>Your treatment will depend on the type of allergic conjunctivitis you have.</p>\n<p>The four main types of allergic conjunctivitis are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>seasonal conjunctivitis &ndash; typically caused by an allergy to pollen</li>\n<li>perennial conjunctivitis &ndash; usually caused by an allergy to dust mites or pets</li>\n<li>contact dermatoconjunctivitis &ndash; usually caused by an allergy to eye drops or cosmetics</li>\n<li>giant papillary conjunctivitis &ndash; usually caused by an allergy to contact lenses</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whatever the cause, you\'ll find that some self-help methods can ease your symptoms.</p>\n<h3>Self care</h3>\n<p>If you have allergic conjunctivitis, you can follow the guidelines below to treat your condition at home.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you wear contact lenses, take them out until all the signs and symptoms of the conjunctivitis have gone.</li>\n<li>Don\'t rub your eyes, even though they may be itchy. Rubbing your eyes can make your symptoms worse.</li>\n<li>Place a cool compress over your eyes.&nbsp;Wetting a flannel with cool water and holding it over your eyes will help ease your symptoms.</li>\n<li>Avoid exposure to the allergen, if possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis</h3>\n<p>If you have seasonal or perennial conjunctivitis, you may be prescribed the following medicines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>antihistamines&nbsp;</li>\n<li>mast cell stabilisers</li>\n<li><a>corticosteroids</a>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are described in more detail below.</p>\n<h3>Antihistamines</h3>\n<p>If allergic conjunctivitis needs rapid relief, your GP will probably prescribe a medicine known as an antihistamine.</p>\n<p>Antihistamines work by blocking the action of the chemical histamine, which the body releases when it thinks it\'s under attack from an allergen. This prevents the symptoms of the allergic reaction occurring.</p>\n<h3>Antihistamine eye drops</h3>\n<p>You may be prescribed antihistamine eye drops, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>azelastine&nbsp;(not suitable for children under four years of age)</li>\n<li>emedastine&nbsp;(not suitable for children under three years of age)</li>\n<li>ketotifen&nbsp;(not suitable for children under three years of age)</li>\n<li>antazoline with xylometazoline (Otrivine-Antistin, not suitable for children under 12 years of age)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Antazoline with xylometazoline (Otrivine-Antistin) is also available over the counter from pharmacies without prescription. Always follow the manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions.</p>\n<p>If you\'re pregnant or breastfeeding, some antihistamine eye drops may not be suitable.&nbsp;Speak to your GP for advice. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Oral antihistamines</h3>\n<p>You may be prescribed an antihistamine such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>cetirizine</li>\n<li>fexofenadine</li>\n<li>loratadine</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You\'ll usually only have to take an antihistamine once a day.</p>\n<p>If possible, oral antihistamines shouldn\'t be taken if you\'re pregnant or breastfeeding. Speak to your GP for advice.</p>\n<p>Although new antihistamines shouldn\'t make you drowsy, they may still have a sedating effect. This is&nbsp;more likely if you take high doses or drink alcohol while you\'re taking antihistamines.</p>\n<h3>Mast cell stabilisers</h3>\n<p>Mast cell stabilisers are an alternative type of medicine. Unlike antihistamines, they won\'t provide rapid symptom relief, but they are better at controlling your symptoms over a longer period of time.</p>\n<p>It may take several weeks to feel the effects of a mast cell stabiliser, so you may also be prescribed an antihistamine to take at the same time.</p>\n<p>Mast cell stabilisers that are commonly prescribed in the form of eye drops include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>lodoxamide</li>\n<li>nedocromil sodium</li>\n<li>sodium cromoglicate</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Corticosteroids</h3>\n<p>If your symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis are particularly severe, you may be prescribed a short course of&nbsp;topical corticosteroids (a cream, gel or ointment). However, these aren\'t usually prescribed unless absolutely necessary.</p>\n<h2>Giant papillary conjunctivitis</h2>\n<p>As giant papillary conjunctivitis is usually caused by contact lenses, the symptoms often clear up after you stop wearing them.

The condition can either be present at birth or develop later in life.</p>\n<h2>Deafblindness&nbsp;from birth</h2>\n<p>Deafblindness from birth is known as congenital deafblindness.</p>\n<p>It can be caused by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>problems associated with&nbsp;premature birth (birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy)</li>\n<li>an infection picked up during pregnancy, such as&nbsp;rubella (German measles),&nbsp;toxoplasmosis or&nbsp;cytomegalovirus (CMV)</li>\n<li>genetic conditions, such as&nbsp;<a>CHARGE syndrome</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>Down\'s syndrome</a></li>\n<li>cerebral palsy&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;a problem with the brain and nervous system that mainly affects movement and co-ordination</li>\n<li><a>foetal alcohol syndrome</a>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;health problems caused by drinking alcohol in pregnancy</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Deafblindness&nbsp;later in life</h2>\n<p>In most cases, deafblindness develops later in life. This is known as acquired deafblindness.</p>\n<p>A person&nbsp;with acquired deafblindness&nbsp;may be&nbsp;born without a hearing or sight&nbsp;problem and then later loses part or all of both senses. Alternatively, someone may be born with either a hearing or vision problem,&nbsp;and then later loses part or all of the other sense later on.</p>\n<p>Problems that can&nbsp;contribute to&nbsp;acquired deafblindness include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>age-related&nbsp;<a>hearing loss</a></li>\n<li><a>Usher syndrome</a>&nbsp;&ndash; a genetic condition that affects hearing, vision and balance</li>\n<li>eye problems associated with&nbsp;increasing age, such as&nbsp;age-related macular degeneration (AMD),&nbsp;cataracts and&nbsp;glaucoma</li>\n<li>diabetic retinopathy&nbsp;&ndash; a complication of&nbsp;<a>diabetes</a>&nbsp;where the cells&nbsp;lining the back of the eye&nbsp;are damaged by high blood sugar levels</li>\n<li>damage to the brain, such as from&nbsp;<a>meningitis</a>, encephalitis, a&nbsp;<a>stroke</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>severe head injury</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Diagnosing deafblindness</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Deafblindness may be detected soon after a baby is born, or after tests carried out later in life.</p>\n<p>Speak to your GP if you have any concerns about your or your child\'s hearing and/or vision at any point.</p>\n<p>If you\'re worried about a family member or friend, try to encourage them to speak to their GP.</p>\n<h2>Newborn screening</h2>\n<p>If&nbsp;your baby is born deafblind, this will usually be picked up during&nbsp;<a>newborn screening</a>.</p>\n<p>These are a series of checks carried out to&nbsp;see if your baby has any serious health problems from birth, including any problems with their eyes or hearing.</p>\n<p>If no problems are picked up at this stage, they may be detected during routine checks as your child gets older.</p>\n<h2>Hearing and vision tests for adults</h2>\n<p>In most cases, deafblindness&nbsp;develops as a person gets older. It can happen gradually, so you may not notice that your vision and/or hearing are getting worse at first.</p>\n<p>It\'s therefore important to have routine eye tests to check for any problems. Adults should normally have their eyes tested every two years.</p>\n<p>You can request a hearing test at your GP surgery at any point if you think you may be losing your hearing.</p>\n<p>A person&nbsp;may be diagnosed with deafblindness if&nbsp;tests show they have&nbsp;both hearing and vision problems.</p>\n<p>Their&nbsp;hearing and vision should continue to be regularly assessed&nbsp;even after they\'ve been diagnosed, as the level of care and support&nbsp;they need will depend on how severely each sense is affected.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h3>Where is my nearest optician?</h3>\n<div>Search for your local optician using Scotland\'s Service Directory.</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Specialist assessment</h2>\n<p>As soon as deafblindness has been identified, a specialist assessment should be arranged by&nbsp;the local authority.</p>\n<p>The assessment&nbsp;should only be carried out by a specially trained professional who&nbsp;is able to identify the deafblind person\'s abilities and&nbsp;needs.&nbsp;The assessment should include assessing their&nbsp;needs in relation to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>communication</li>\n<li>one-to-one human contact</li>\n<li>social interaction</li>\n<li>emotional wellbeing</li>\n<li>support with mobility</li>\n<li>assistive technology</li>\n<li>rehabilitation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The assessment will also take&nbsp;into account the person\'s current needs and those that develop in the future.</p>\n<p>A deafblind person should have access to services suitable to their level of hearing and sight and their individual needs. Mainstream services aimed mainly at blind or deaf people may not always be appropriate.</p>\n<h2>Managing deafblindness</h2>\n<div>\n<p>It\'s not always possible to treat the underlying causes of deafblindness, but a range of care and support services is available to help people with the condition.</p>\n<p>Most deafblind people will still have some hearing and/or vision. The level of care and support they need will depend on&nbsp;how severe their hearing and vision problems are.</p>\n<h2>Individual care plan</h2>\n<p>The individual abilities and needs of a deafblind person should be assessed soon after they\'re diagnosed. This will allow a tailored care plan to be drawn up.</p>\n<p>The care plan will aim to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>preserve and maximise any remaining sensory functions the person has</li>\n<li>teach alternative communication methods such as the deafblind manual alphabet (see below)</li>\n<li>help the person retain as much independence as possible &ndash; for example, by recommending they receive training to use a long cane or guide dog or through the provision of a communicator guide</li>\n<li>for young children,&nbsp;ensure their educational needs are met</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Communication systems</h2>\n<p>As deafblindness can make communicating by speech and writing difficult, alternative forms of communication may be necessary.</p>\n<p>The main communication systems&nbsp;used by deafblind people include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>clear speech &ndash; speaking clearly is one of the most effective and common ways of communicating with deafblind people who have some remaining vision and hearing</li>\n<li>deafblind manual alphabet &ndash;&nbsp;a tactile form of communication where words are spelt onto the deafblind person\'s hand using set positions and movements</li>\n<li>block alphabet &ndash; a simple tactile form of communication where a word is spelt out in capital letters that are drawn onto the deafblind person\'s palm</li>\n<li>hands-on signing &ndash; an adapted version of British Sign Language (BSL)&nbsp;where&nbsp;the deafblind person feels what\'s being signed by placing their hands on top of the signer\'s hand</li>\n<li>visual frame signing &ndash; an adapted version of BSL where&nbsp;the signs are adapted to be signed in a smaller space to match the position and size of a deafblind person\'s remaining sight</li>\n<li>braille &ndash; a system that uses&nbsp;a series of raised dots to represent letters or groups of letters</li>\n<li>moon &ndash;&nbsp;similar to Braille, but uses raised, adapted capital letters that are simpler to feel</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Vision aids</h2>\n<p>For some&nbsp;deafblind people, it may be possible to improve vision using low vision aids, such as glasses, magnifying lenses and task lights.</p>\n<p>Specially designed items, such as telephones and keyboards, may also help someone who is visually impaired.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<a>Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB)</a>&nbsp;has more information about&nbsp;<a>everyday living with vision loss</a>,&nbsp;including advice about the technology available&nbsp;to help with everyday tasks.</p>\n<h2>Hearing aids and implants</h2>\n<p>Some deafblind people may benefit from wearing a&nbsp;hearing aid. There are various hearing aid styles available to suit different types of hearing loss and personal preference.</p>\n<p>Hearing aids use microphones to collect the sound from the environment, amplify it and deliver it into the ear canal of the wearer so that it can be processed by the auditory system. An audiologist (hearing specialist) will be able to recommend the most suitable type of aid after testing your hearing.</p>\n<p>For some people, hearing aids that deliver the sound into the ear canal are not appropriate. In these cases, hearing may be improved using a surgically implanted hearing system, such as a cochlea implant or bone conducting hearing implant.</p>\n<p>While these still use a microphone to collect the sound initially, they then covert that sound into either an electrical signal or vibration, passing it to the inner or middle ear for processing by the auditory system.</p>\n<h2>One-to-one support</h2>\n<p>Every deafblind person is entitled to help from a&nbsp;specially trained one-to-one support worker if they need it.</p>\n<p>Depending on the person\'s situation, this may be a:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>communicator guide &ndash;&nbsp;someone who works with people who have become deafblind later in life, to offer the support the person needs to live independently</li>\n<li>interpreter &ndash;&nbsp;someone who acts as a communication link between the deafblind person and other people, using the deafblind person\'s preferred method of communication</li>\n<li>intervenor &ndash;&nbsp;someone who&nbsp;works with&nbsp;children and adults who were born deafblind, to help them experience and join in the world around them as much as possible</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Treating underlying&nbsp;conditions</h2>\n<p>Some conditions that affect hearing and vision can be treated using medication or surgery. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>cataracts&nbsp;can often be treated by surgically implanting an artificial lens in the eye</li>\n<li>glaucoma&nbsp;can often be treated using eye drops&nbsp;or laser surgery &ndash; read more about treating glaucoma</li>\n<li>diabetic retinopathy can be treated in the early stages using laser surgery</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(82,81,NULL,NULL,'<h1>Diabetic retinopathy:</h1>\n<h2>Stages of diabetic retinopathy</h2>\n<div >\n<p>Diabetic retinopathy develops in stages over time.</p>\n<p>If you\'re diagnosed with&nbsp;diabetic retinopathy after&nbsp;<a>diabetic eye screening</a>, lifestyle changes and/or treatment can reduce the chances of the problem progressing.</p>\n<p>The main stages of diabetic retinopathy are described below.

This means you will not experience any pain or have any awareness of the surgery being performed.</p>\n<h3>After the procedure</h3>\n<p>You should be able to go home on the same day or the day after your surgery.</p>\n<p>For the first few days, you may need to wear a&nbsp;patch over&nbsp;your&nbsp;eye.&nbsp;This is because activities such as reading and watching television can quickly tire your eye to begin with.</p>\n<p>You will probably have blurred vision after the operation.

The glands are attached to hair follicles, which are small holes in your skin that an individual hair grows out of.</p>\n<p>Sebaceous glands lubricate the hair and the skin to stop it drying out. They do this by producing an oily substance called sebum.</p>\n<p>In acne, the glands begin to produce too much sebum. The excess sebum mixes with dead skin cells and both substances form a plug in the follicle.</p>\n<p>If the plugged follicle is close to the surface of the skin, it bulges outwards, creating a whitehead. Alternatively, the plugged follicle can be open to the skin, creating a blackhead.</p>\n<p>Normally harmless bacteria that live on the skin can then contaminate and infect the plugged follicles, causing papules, pustules, nodules or cysts.</p>\n<h2>Testosterone&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Teenage acne&nbsp;is thought to be triggered by increased levels of a hormone called testosterone, which occurs during puberty. The hormone plays an important role in stimulating the growth and development of the penis and testicles in boys, and maintaining muscle and bone strength in girls.</p>\n<p>The sebaceous glands are particularly sensitive to hormones.&nbsp;It\'s thought that increased levels of&nbsp;testosterone cause the glands to produce much more sebum than the skin needs.</p>\n<h2>Acne in families</h2>\n<p>Acne&nbsp;can run in families. If your parents had acne, it\'s likely that you\'ll also develop it.</p>\n<p>One study has found that if both your parents had acne, you\'re more likely to get more severe acne at an early age. It also found that if one or both of your parents had adult acne, you\'re more likely to get adult acne too.</p>\n<h2>Acne in women</h2>\n<p>More than&nbsp;80% of&nbsp;cases of adult acne&nbsp;occur in women. It\'s thought that many cases of adult acne are&nbsp;caused by&nbsp;the changes in hormone levels that many women have at certain times.</p>\n<p>These times&nbsp;include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>periods&nbsp;&ndash; some women have a flare-up of acne just before their period</li>\n<li><a>pregnancy&nbsp;</a>&ndash; many women have symptoms of acne at this time, usually during the first 3&nbsp;months of their pregnancy</li>\n<li><a>polycystic ovary syndrome</a>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;a common condition that can cause acne, weight gain and the formation of small cysts inside the ovary</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Other triggers</h2>\n<p>Other possible triggers of an acne flare-up include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>some cosmetic products&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;however, this is less common as most products are now tested,&nbsp;so they don\'t cause spots&nbsp;(non-comedogenic)</li>\n<li>certain medications&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;such as&nbsp;<a>steroid medications</a>, lithium&nbsp;(used to treat&nbsp;<a>depression</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a >bipolar disorder</a>) and&nbsp;some anti-epileptic drugs (used to treat&nbsp;<a>epilepsy</a>)</li>\n<li>regularly wearing items that place pressure on an affected area of skin, such as&nbsp;a headband or backpack</li>\n<li><a>smoking</a>&nbsp;&ndash; which can contribute to acne in older people</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Acne myths</h2>\n<p>Despite being one of the most widespread skin conditions, acne is also one of the most poorly understood.&nbsp;There are&nbsp;many myths and misconceptions about it:</p>\n<h3>\"Acne is caused by a poor diet\"</h3>\n<p>So far, research hasn\'t found any foods that cause acne. Eating a healthy, balanced diet is recommended because it\'s good for your heart and your health in general.</p>\n<h3>\"Acne is caused by having dirty skin and poor hygiene\"</h3>\n<p>Most of the biological reactions that trigger acne occur beneath the skin, not on the surface, so&nbsp;the cleanliness of your skin&nbsp;has&nbsp;no effect on your acne. Washing your face more than twice a day could just aggravate your skin.</p>\n<h3>\"Squeezing blackheads, whiteheads and spots is the best way to get rid of acne\"&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>This could actually make symptoms worse and may leave you with scarring.</p>\n<h3>\"Sexual activity can influence acne\"</h3>\n<p>Having sex or masturbating won\'t make acne any better or worse.</p>\n<h3>\"Sunbathing, sunbeds and sunlamps help improve the symptoms of acne\"</h3>\n<p>There\'s no conclusive evidence that prolonged exposure to sunlight or using sunbeds or sunlamps can improve acne. Many medications used to treat acne can make your skin more sensitive to light, so exposure could cause painful damage to your skin, and also increase your risk of skin cancer.</p>\n<h3>\"Acne is infectious\"</h3>\n<p>You can\'t pass acne on to other people.</p>\n<h2>Diagnosing acne</h2>\n<div class=\"editor\">\n<p>Your pharmacist can diagnose acne by looking at your skin. This involves examining your face and possibly your chest and back for different types of spot, such as blackheads or sore, red nodules.</p>\n<p>How many spots you have and how painful and inflamed they are will help determine how severe your acne is. This is&nbsp;important in planning your treatment.</p>\n<p>4&nbsp;grades can be used to measure the severity of acne:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>grade 1 (mild) &ndash; acne is mostly confined to whiteheads and blackheads, with just a few papules and pustules</li>\n<li>grade 2 (moderate) &ndash; there are multiple papules and pustules, which are mostly confined to the face</li>\n<li>grade 3 (moderately severe) &ndash; there\'s a large number of papules and pustules, as well as the occasional inflamed nodule, and the back and chest are also affected by acne</li>\n<li>grade 4 (severe) &ndash; there\'s a large number of large, painful pustules and nodules</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Acne in women</h2>\n<p>If acne suddenly starts&nbsp;in adult women, it&nbsp;can be a sign of a hormonal imbalance, especially if it\'s accompanied by other symptoms such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>excessive body hair (hirsutism)</li>\n<li>irregular or light periods</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The most common cause of hormonal imbalances in women is&nbsp;polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS can be diagnosed using a combination of&nbsp;<a>ultrasound scans</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a>blood tests</a>.</p>\n<h2>Treating acne</h2>\n<p>Treatment for acne depends on how severe it is. It can take several months of treatment before acne symptoms improve.</p>\n<p>The various treatments for acne are outlined below.</p>\n<p>If you just have a few blackheads, whiteheads and spots, you should be able to treat them successfully with over-the-counter gels or creams (topical treatments) that contain benzoyl peroxide.</p>\n<h2>Treatments from your GP</h2>\n<p>See your GP if your acne is more widespread,&nbsp;as you probably need prescription medication.&nbsp;For example, if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you have a large number of papules and pustules</li>\n<li>over-the-counter medication hasn\'t worked</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Prescription medications that can be used to treat acne include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>topical retinoids</li>\n<li>topical&nbsp;<a >antibiotics</a></li>\n<li>azelaic acid</li>\n<li>antibiotic tablets</li>\n<li>in women, the&nbsp;<a>combined oral contraceptive pill</a></li>\n<li>isotretinoin tablets</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have severe acne,&nbsp;your GP can refer you to an expert in treating skin conditions (dermatologist). For example, if you have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a large number of papules and pustules on your chest and back, as well as your face</li>\n<li>painful nodules</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A combination of&nbsp;antibiotic tablets and topical treatments is usually the first treatment option for severe acne. If this doesn\'t work, a medication called&nbsp;isotretinoin may be prescribed.</p>\n<p>Hormonal therapies or the combined oral contraceptive pill can also be effective in women who have acne. However, the&nbsp;<a>progestogen-only pill</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>contraceptive implant</a>&nbsp;can sometimes make acne worse.</p>\n<p>Many of these treatments can take 2&nbsp;to 3&nbsp;months before they start to work. It\'s important to be patient and persist with a recommended treatment, even if&nbsp;there\'s no immediate effect.</p>\n<h2>Topical treatments (gels, creams and lotions)</h2>\n<h3>Benzoyl peroxide</h3>\n<p>Benzoyl peroxide works as an antiseptic to reduce the number of bacteria on the surface of the skin. It also helps to reduce the number of whiteheads and blackheads, and has an anti-inflammatory effect.</p>\n<p>Benzoyl peroxide is usually available as a cream or gel. It\'s used either once or twice a day. It should be applied 20 minutes after washing to all of the parts of your face affected by acne.</p>\n<p>It should be used sparingly, as too much can irritate your skin. It also makes your face more sensitive to sunlight, so avoid too much sun and ultraviolet (UV) light, or wear sun cream.</p>\n<p>Benzoyl peroxide can have a bleaching effect, so avoid getting it on your hair or&nbsp;clothes.</p>\n<p>Common side effects of benzoyl peroxide include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>dry and tense skin</li>\n<li>a burning, itching or stinging sensation</li>\n<li>some redness and peeling of the skin</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Side effects are usually mild and should pass once the treatment has finished.</p>\n<p>Most people need a 6 week course of treatment to clear most or all of their acne. You may be advised to continue treatment less frequently to prevent acne returning.</p>\n<h3>Topical retinoids</h3>\n<p>Topical retinoids work by&nbsp;removing dead skin cells from the surface of the skin (exfoliating)&nbsp;which helps&nbsp;to prevent them building up within hair follicles.</p>\n<p>Tretinoin and adapalene are topical retinoids used to treat acne. They\'re available in a gel or cream and are usually applied once a day before you go to bed.</p>\n<p>Apply to all the parts of your face affected by acne 20 minutes after washing your face.</p>\n<p>It\'s important to apply topical retinoids sparingly and avoid excessive exposure to sunlight and UV.</p>\n<p>Topical retinoids aren\'t suitable for use during pregnancy, as there\'s a risk they might cause birth defects.</p>\n<p>The most common side effects of topical retinoids are mild irritation and stinging of the skin.</p>\n<p>A 6 week course is usually required, but you may be advised to continue using the medication less frequently after this.</p>\n<h3>Topical antibiotics</h3>\n<p>Topical antibiotics help kill the bacteria on the skin that can infect plugged hair follicles. They\'re available as a lotion or gel that is applied once or twice a day.</p>\n<p>A 6 to 8&nbsp;week course is usually recommended. After this, treatment is usually stopped, as there\'s a risk that the bacteria on your face could become resistant to the antibiotics. This could make your acne worse and cause additional infections.</p>\n<p>Side effects are uncommon, but can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>minor irritation of the skin</li>\n<li>redness and burning of the skin</li>\n<li>peeling of the skin</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Azelaic acid</h3>\n<p>Azelaic acid is often used as an alternative treatment for acne if the side effects of benzoyl peroxide or topical retinoids are particularly irritating or painful.</p>\n<p>Azelaic acid works by getting rid of dead skin and killing bacteria. It\'s available&nbsp;as a&nbsp;cream or gel and is usually applied twice a day (or once a day if your skin is particularly sensitive).</p>\n<p>The medication doesn\'t make your skin sensitive to sunlight, so you don\'t have to avoid exposure to the sun.</p>\n<p>You\'ll usually need to use azelaic acid for a month before your acne improves.</p>\n<p>The side effects of azelaic acid are usually mild and include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>burning or stinging skin</li>\n<li>itchiness</li>\n<li>dry skin</li>\n<li>redness of the skin</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Antibiotic tablets</h2>\n<p>Antibiotic tablets (oral antibiotics) are usually used in combination with a topical treatment to treat more severe acne.</p>\n<p>In most cases, a class of antibiotics called tetracyclines is prescribed, unless you\'re pregnant or breastfeeding.</p>\n<p>Pregnant or breastfeeding women are usually advised to take an antibiotic called erythromycin, which is known to be safer to use.</p>\n<p>It usually takes about 6&nbsp;weeks before you notice an improvement in your acne.</p>\n<p>Depending on how well you react to the treatment, a course of oral antibiotics can last 4&nbsp;to 6&nbsp;months.</p>\n<p>Tetracyclines can make your skin sensitive to sunlight and UV light, and can also make the oral contraceptive pill less effective during the first few weeks of treatment.</p>\n<p>You\'ll need to use an alternative method of contraception, such as&nbsp;<a>condoms</a>, during this time.</p>\n<h2>Hormonal therapies</h2>\n<p>Hormonal therapies can often benefit women with acne, especially if the acne flares up around&nbsp;periods or&nbsp;is associated with hormonal conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome.</p>\n<p>If you don\'t already use it, your GP may recommend the&nbsp;<a>combined oral contraceptive pill</a>, even if you\'re not sexually active. This combined pill can often help improve acne in women, but may take up to a year before the full benefits are seen.</p>\n<h3>Co-cyprindiol</h3>\n<p>Co-cyprindiol is a hormonal treatment that can be used for more severe acne&nbsp;that doesn\'t respond to antibiotics. It helps to reduce the production of sebum.</p>\n<p>You\'ll probably have to use co-cyprindiol for 2&nbsp;to 6&nbsp;months before you notice a significant improvement in your acne.</p>\n<p>There\'s a small risk&nbsp;that women taking co-cyprindiol may develop&nbsp;<a>breast cancer</a>&nbsp;in later life.</p>\n<p>For example, out of a group of 10,000 women who haven\'t taken co-cyprindiol, you would expect 16 of them to develop breast cancer by the time they were 35. This figure rises to 17 or 18 for women who were treated with co-cyprindiol for at least 5&nbsp;years in their early twenties.</p>\n<p>There\'s also a very small chance of co-cyprindiol causing a blood clot. The risk&nbsp;is&nbsp;estimated to&nbsp;be around 1 in 2,500 in any given year.</p>\n<p>It\'s not thought to be safe to take co-cyprindiol if you\'re pregnant or breastfeeding.&nbsp;Women may need to have a pregnancy test before treatment can begin.</p>\n<p>Other side effects of co-cyprindiol include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>bleeding and spotting between your periods, which&nbsp;can sometimes occur for the first few months</li>\n<li>headaches</li>\n<li>sore breasts</li>\n<li>mood changes</li>\n<li>loss of interest in sex</li>\n<li>weight gain or weight loss</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Isotretinoin</h2>\n<p>Isotretinoin&nbsp;has a number of beneficial effects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it helps to normalise sebum and reduce how much is&nbsp;produced</li>\n<li>it helps to prevent follicles becoming clogged</li>\n<li>it decreases the amount of bacteria on the skin</li>\n<li>it reduces redness and swelling in and around spots</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However,&nbsp;the drug&nbsp;can also cause a wide range of side effects. It\'s only recommended for severe cases of acne that haven\'t responded to other treatments.</p>\n<p>Because of the risk of side effects, isotretinoin can only be prescribed by a specially trained GP or a&nbsp;dermatologist.</p>\n<p>Isotretinoin is taken&nbsp;as a&nbsp;tablet. Most people take a 4&nbsp;to 6 month course. Your acne may get worse during the first 7 to 10 days of treatment. However, this is normal and soon settles.</p>\n<p>Common side effects of isotretinoin include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>inflammation, dryness and cracking of the skin, lips and nostrils</li>\n<li>changes in your blood sugar levels</li>\n<li>inflammation of your eyelids (blepharitis)</li>\n<li><a>inflammation and irritation of your eyes (conjunctivitis)</a></li>\n<li>blood in your urine</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rarer side effects of isotretinoin include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a>inflammation of the liver (hepatitis)</a></li>\n<li><a>inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)</a></li>\n<li><a>kidney disease</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because of the risk of these rarer side effects, you\'ll need a&nbsp;<a>blood test</a>&nbsp;before and during treatment.</p>\n<h3>Isotretinoin and birth defects</h3>\n<p>Isotretinoin will damage an unborn baby. If you\'re a woman of childbearing age:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>don\'t use isotretinoin if you\'re&nbsp;pregnant or you think you\'re pregnant</li>\n<li>use 1, or ideally 2, methods of contraception for 1&nbsp;month before treatment begins, during treatment and for 1&nbsp;month after treatment has finished</li>\n<li>have a pregnancy test before, during and after treatment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You\'ll be asked to sign a form confirming that you understand the risk of birth defects and are willing to use contraceptives to prevent this risk, even if you\'re not currently sexually active.</p>\n<p>If you think you may&nbsp;have become pregnant when taking isotretinoin, contact your dermatologist immediately.</p>\n<p>Isotretinoin is also not suitable if you\'re breastfeeding.</p>\n<h3>Isotretinoin and mood changes</h3>\n<p>There have been reports of people experiencing mood changes while taking isotretinoin. There\'s no evidence that these mood changes were the result of the medication.</p>\n<p>However, as a precaution, contact your doctor immediately if you feel depressed or anxious, have feelings of aggression or suicidal thoughts.</p>\n<h2>Non-pharmaceutical treatments</h2>\n<p>Several treatments for acne don\'t involve medication.</p>\n<p>These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>comedone extractor &ndash; a small pen-shaped instrument that can be used to clean out blackheads and whiteheads</li>\n<li>chemical peels &ndash; where a chemical solution is applied to the face, causing the skin to peel off and new skin to replace it</li>\n<li>photodynamic therapy &ndash; where light is applied to the skin in an attempt to improve symptoms of acne</li>\n</ul>\n</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(95,94,NULL,NULL,'<h1>Angioedema:</h1>\n<h2>Symptoms of angioedema</h2>\n<p>The main sign of angioedema is swelling that develops below the skin\'s surface.</p>\n<h2>Swollen skin</h2>\n<p>The swelling is caused by a collection of fluid in the deep layers of the skin.</p>\n<p>It most often affects the hands, feet, eyes, lips, or genitals. In severe cases, the inside lining of the throat and bowel can be affected (see below).</p>\n<p>The swelling&nbsp;usually appears suddenly, and is more severe than normal hives (nettle rash). It commonly lasts 1&nbsp;to 3&nbsp;days. There may be a prickling sensation in the affected area before swelling is visible.</p>\n<p>The swelling is not itchy and the skin may look a normal colour; however, many people with allergic or idiopathic angioedema also develop&nbsp;<a>urticaria (hives)</a>, which is red and itchy.</p>\n<h2>Other symptoms</h2>\n<p>As well as visible swellings, angioedema can cause other symptoms, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a hot or painful&nbsp;sensation in the swollen areas</li>\n<li>swelling of the inside of the throat, the&nbsp;windpipe and the tongue, making breathing difficult</li>\n<li>swelling of the conjunctiva (the transparent layer of cells that cover the white part of the eye), which affects&nbsp;vision</li>\n</ul>\n<p>People with hereditary angioedema may also experience:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>abdominal (stomach) pain caused by swelling in the stomach and bowel, which can cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea</li>\n<li>swelling of the bladder or urethra (the tube that connects the bladder to the genitals), which can cause bladder problems and difficulty passing urine</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>When to seek medical advice</h2>\n<p>Contact your GP if you have an episode of angioedema that does not affect your breathing and you have not previously been diagnosed with the condition. You will need to have tests to determine what type of angioedema you have.</p>\n<h2>When to seek emergency medical advice</h2>\n<p>Dial 999 to request an ambulance if you suspect that you, or someone you know, is experiencing&nbsp;<a>anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction)</a>. Tell the operator that you suspect anaphylaxis.</p>\n<p>Initial symptoms of anaphylaxis include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a feeling of tightness in the chest that leads to&nbsp;breathing problems&nbsp;</li>\n<li>swelling of the tongue and throat</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Causes of angioedema</h2>\n<p>Angioedema is often caused by a problem with the immune system, although there are many cases where no cause can be identified.</p>\n<h2>Allergic angioedema</h2>\n<p>Normally, your immune system protects your body from illness and infection by attacking germs in your body.</p>\n<p>In allergic angioedema, your immune system mistakenly attacks harmless substances in your blood. Your body produces the chemical histamine, which causes the blood vessels in the area to expand, leading to swelling of the skin.</p>\n<p>Substances known to trigger allergic angioedema include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>certain types of food &ndash; particularly nuts, shellfish, milk and eggs</li>\n<li>some types of medication&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;such as penicillin, aspirin and&nbsp;<a>non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</a>, such as ibuprofen</li>\n<li><a>insect bites and stings</a>&nbsp;&ndash; particularly wasp and bee stings</li>\n<li>latex &ndash; a naturally occurring rubber used to make medical gloves, balloons and condoms</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Idiopathic angioedema</h2>\n<p>Cases of angioedema without an identifiable cause are known as idiopathic angioedema. It may be that a problem with the immune system sometimes causes it to \"misfire\".</p>\n<p>In cases of&nbsp;idiopathic angioedema, certain triggers may lead to swelling, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>anxiety or stress</li>\n<li>minor infections</li>\n<li>hot or cold temperatures</li>\n<li>exercise</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Avoiding these triggers whenever possible may improve your symptoms.</p>\n<h2>Drug-induced angioedema</h2>\n<p>Some medications can cause angioedema. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which are used to treat&nbsp;<a>high blood pressure (hypertension)</a>, are usually responsible.</p>\n<p>It\'s estimated that around&nbsp;1-5% of&nbsp;people taking ACE inhibitors will develop drug-induced angioedema. Black people being treated with ACE inhibitors are 3&nbsp;to 4&nbsp;times more likely to develop this side effect than white people.</p>\n<p>Around 1&nbsp;in 4&nbsp;cases of drug-induced angioedema occurs during the first month of taking an ACE inhibitor. The remaining cases develop many months or even years after treatment begins.</p>\n<p>While they are useful in lowering blood pressure, ACE inhibitors can sometimes disrupt the \"chemical balance\" and trigger an episode of severe swelling.</p>\n<p>Less common causes of drug-induced angioedema include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>bupropion &ndash;&nbsp;a medication that helps people to&nbsp;<a>give up smoking</a></li>\n<li>vaccines</li>\n<li><a>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</a>&nbsp;&ndash; a type of antidepressant</li>\n<li>COX-II inhibitors &ndash; a type of painkiller used to treat chronic pain conditions such as&nbsp;<a>arthritis</a></li>\n<li>NSAIDs &ndash; a type of painkiller, such as aspirin or&nbsp;<a>ibuprofen</a></li>\n<li>angiotensin-2 receptor antagonists &ndash;&nbsp;another medication used to treat high blood pressure</li>\n<li><a>statins</a>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;used to treat people with&nbsp;<a>high cholesterol levels</a></li>\n<li>proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) &ndash;&nbsp;used to treat&nbsp;<a>stomach ulcers</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Hereditary angioedema</h2>\n<p>Hereditary angioedema is caused by a genetic mutation (a change in the DNA) in the C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-inh) gene. Genes are single units of genetic material that code for characteristics such as eye and hair colour.</p>\n<p>As a result of the mutated C1-inh&nbsp;gene, the body does not make enough C1-inh&nbsp;protein. This protein plays an important role in regulating the immune system. Without enough C1-inh&nbsp;protein, the immune system can misfire and trigger the symptoms of angioedema.</p>\n<p>Certain&nbsp;things are thought to trigger hereditary angioedema, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>trauma&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;including surgery or infection</li>\n<li>the oral contraceptive pill</li>\n<li>pregnancy</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Treating angioedema</h2>\n<p>Medication is the main treatment for angioedema, although many cases get better after a few days without treatment.</p>\n<p>Allergic angioedema and idiopathic angioedema are usually treated in the same way, using a combination of antihistamines and&nbsp;<a>corticosteroids</a>&nbsp;to help relieve the swelling.</p>\n<p>Drug-induced angioedema can usually be treated by using an alternative medication to the one causing your symptoms.</p>\n<p>If you also had symptoms of anaphylaxis during an episode of angioedema, you will probably be given an adrenaline auto-injector pen in case your symptoms return.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hereditary angioedema cannot be cured and does not respond to adrenaline, antihistamines or steroids, so a preventative approach is taken.&nbsp;A number of different medications are used to stabilise the protein levels in your blood to help prevent symptoms developing.</p>\n<h2>Antihistamines</h2>\n<p>Antihistamines work by blocking the effects of a protein called histamine, which is one of the chemicals responsible for causing your skin to swell.</p>\n<p>A 2-week course of&nbsp;a non-sedating type of antihistamine (which does not cause drowsiness) is usually recommended &ndash; these include fexofenadine and cetirizine. Cetirizine can be bought over the counter in pharmacies and supermarkets without a prescription.</p>\n<p>Antihistamines can also be given by injection at hospital or your GP surgery.</p>\n<p>If you also have&nbsp;<a>urticaria (hives)</a>&nbsp;and are being kept awake at night by itchy skin, your GP may prescribe an older type of antihistamine&nbsp;to take before going to bed. These types&nbsp;cause drowsiness and should help you sleep.</p>\n<p>A minority of people will still experience drowsiness after taking the newer type of antihistamines. If you find yourself feeling drowsy, you should avoid:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>driving</li>\n<li>drinking alcohol</li>\n<li>operating complex or heavy machinery</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other side effects of the newer antihistamines include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>headache</li>\n<li>dry mouth</li>\n<li>dry nose</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These side effects are usually short-lived and should pass quickly.</p>\n<h2>Corticosteroids</h2>\n<p><a>Corticosteroids (steroids)</a>&nbsp;work by blocking many of your immune system\'s actions. In most cases, a 3&nbsp;to 5&nbsp;day course of steroid tablets is recommended. A steroid called prednisolone is the preferred choice.</p>\n<p>Side effects of prednisolone include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>nausea</li>\n<li>abdominal (stomach) pain</li>\n<li>tiredness</li>\n<li><a>oral thrush</a>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;a fungal infection inside your mouth</li>\n<li>dizziness</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you feel dizzy after taking prednisolone, avoid driving and operating heavy machinery. These side effects should pass once you finish the course of treatment.</p>\n<p>Steroid injections may be needed for more severe cases of angioedema. These are usually administered in hospitals or at specialist clinics&nbsp;by an allergy specialist or immunologist (a doctor who specialises in treating conditions that affect the immune system).</p>\n<h2>Medication for hereditary angioedema</h2>\n<p>The medication used to treat hereditary angioedema falls into 1&nbsp;of 2&nbsp;categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>medication used to prevent angioedema</li>\n<li>medication used to relieve symptoms</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Danazol</h3>\n<p>Danazol is a synthetic hormone that is effective in preventing the symptoms of angioedema because it helps boost levels of the C1-inh protein.</p>\n<p>However, danazol can cause a number of unpleasant side effects if used on a long-term basis. For example, it may cause:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>weight gain</li>\n<li><a>depression</a></li>\n<li>disruption to the menstrual cycle&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;such as&nbsp;irregular periods or&nbsp;absent periods</li>\n<li><a>high blood pressure</a></li>\n<li>in women, changes to the body that are usually associated with men&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;such as excessive&nbsp;body hair growth, flattening of the chest, deepening of the voice and an increase in muscle tone</li>\n<li>liver problems</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Due to&nbsp;these side effects, many people with hereditary angioedema are uneasy about using danazol on a long-term basis. Stanozolol is a similar medication that is slightly better tolerated.</p>\n<h3>Tranexamic acid</h3>\n<p>Tranexamic acid is also an alternative medication to danazol. It can be as effective as danazol, but does not cause as many side effects and is preferred for use in women.</p>\n<h3>Icatibant</h3>\n<p>Icatibant is a relatively new medication used to treat acute (short-lasting) episodes of swelling. It works by blocking the effects of some of the chemicals that are responsible for causing the swelling in cases of hereditary angioedema.</p>\n<p>Icatibant is given by injection under the skin, and a&nbsp;second injection is often required.</p>\n<p>Common side effects of icatibant include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>adverse skin reactions at the site of the injection&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;such as pain, redness, swelling or itchiness</li>\n<li>itchiness in other areas of the skin&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>dizziness</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>C1-inhibitors</h3>\n<p>Purified C1-inhibitor concentrate is widely used to replace the missing protein in the blood. It\'s needed for patients undergoing surgery, to prevent attacks caused by surgical trauma. It\'s used to treat acute attacks and is injected directly into the vein.</p>\n<p>Many patients will keep supplies of their concentrate at home for emergency use.</p>\n<p>Icatibant and C1-inhibitor concentrate will be prescribed by the specialist immunology unit caring for the patient with hereditary angioedema.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(96,95,NULL,NULL,'<h2>About fungal nail infection</h2>\n<p>Many people develop a fungal nail infection at some point in their life. It\'s not usually serious, but can be unpleasant and difficult to treat.</p>\n<p>The infection develops slowly and causes the nail to become discoloured, thickened and distorted.</p>\n<p>Toenails are more frequently affected than the fingernails.</p>\n<p>The medical name for a fungal nail infection is onychomycosis.</p>\n<h2>Signs and symptoms of a fungal nail infection</h2>\n<p>A fungal nail infection may not cause any obvious symptoms at first.</p>\n<p>As it progresses, the infection can cause:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>discolouration of the nail &ndash; it may turn&nbsp;white, black, yellow or green</li>\n<li>thickening and distortion of the nail &ndash; it may become an unusual shape or texture and be&nbsp;difficult to trim</li>\n<li>pain or discomfort &ndash; particularly when using or placing pressure on the affected toe or finger</li>\n<li>brittle or crumbly nails &ndash; pieces may break off and come away completely</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sometimes the skin nearby may also become infected and be itchy and cracked or red and swollen.</p>\n<h2>How do you get a fungal nail infection?</h2>\n<p>Most fungal nail infections occur as a result of&nbsp;the fungi that cause athlete\'s foot infecting the nails.</p>\n<p>These fungi often live harmlessly on your skin, but they can sometimes multiply and lead to infections. The fungi prefer warm, dark and moist places like the feet.</p>\n<p>You\'re more likely to get a fungal nail infection if you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>don\'t keep your feet clean and dry</li>\n<li>wear shoes that cause your feet to get hot and sweaty</li>\n<li>walk around barefoot in places where fungal infections can spread easily, such as communal showers, locker rooms and gyms</li>\n<li>have damaged&nbsp;your nails</li>\n<li>have a weakened immune system</li>\n<li>have certain other health conditions, such as&nbsp;<a>diabetes</a>,&nbsp;<a>psoriasis</a>&nbsp;or peripheral arterial disease&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fungal nail infections can be spread to other people, so you should take steps to avoid this (see below)&nbsp;if you have an infection.</p>\n<h2>Treatments for fungal nail infections</h2>\n<p>Treatment isn\'t always needed for&nbsp;a mild fungal nail&nbsp;infection because it\'s unlikely to cause any further problems and you may feel it\'s not worth treating.</p>\n<p>Whether you decide to have treatment or not, you should&nbsp;still practise good foot hygiene (see below) to stop the infection getting worse or&nbsp;spreading to others.</p>\n<p>Speak to your GP or pharmacist if you\'re&nbsp;bothered by the appearance of the affected nail, or it\'s causing problems such as pain and discomfort. They\'ll probably recommend:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>antifungal tablets&nbsp;&ndash; tablets taken once or twice a day for several months</li>\n<li>antifungal nail paints &ndash; special paints applied directly to the nail over several months</li>\n<li>nail softening kits &ndash; where a paste is used to soften infected parts of the nail, before they\'re removed with a scraping device</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A procedure to remove the&nbsp;nail completely may be recommended&nbsp;in severe cases. Laser treatment, where a high-energy laser is used to destroy the fungus, is also an option. But this is&nbsp;only available privately&nbsp;and can be expensive.</p>\n<h2>Preventing fungal nail infections</h2>\n<p>You can reduce your risk of developing a fungal nail infection&nbsp;by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>keeping your&nbsp;hands and feet&nbsp;clean and dry</li>\n<li>wearing well-fitting shoes made of natural materials and clean cotton socks&nbsp;&ndash; these&nbsp;will allow your feet to \"breathe\"</li>\n<li>clipping your nails to keep them short&nbsp;&ndash; don\'t share clippers or scissors with other people</li>\n<li>not sharing towels and socks with other people, and ensure your towels are washed regularly</li>\n<li>not&nbsp;walking around barefoot&nbsp;in public pools, showers, and locker rooms&nbsp;&ndash; special&nbsp;shower shoes are available to protect your feet</li>\n<li>replacing old footwear&nbsp;that could be contaminated with fungi</li>\n<li>treating athlete\'s foot&nbsp;as soon as possible to avoid the infection spreading to your nails</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nail salon equipment can sometimes be the source of fungal nail infections. If you regularly visit a salon, make sure any equipment used is properly sterilised between uses.</p>\n<h2>Treating fungal nail infection</h2>\n<div class=\"editor\">\n<p>Treatment may not be necessary in mild cases of fungal nail infection. For more severe or troublesome cases, antifungal medication may be recommended.</p>\n<p>A fungal nail infection is unlikely to get better without treatment, but if you\'re not bothered by it you might decide it\'s not worth treating because treatment can take a long time, may cause side effects, and isn\'t always effective.</p>\n<p>Whether or not you decide to have treatment, you should still follow the self-help advice below to help stop the condition getting worse or spreading to others.</p>\n<h2>Things you can try</h2>\n<p>The advice below may be helpful if you have a fungal nail infection:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>keep your&nbsp;hands and feet&nbsp;clean and dry</li>\n<li>wear well-fitting shoes made of natural materials and clean cotton socks&nbsp;&ndash; these&nbsp;will allow your feet to \"breathe\"</li>\n<li>clip your nails to keep them short&nbsp;&ndash; use a separate pair of clippers or scissors for the infected nail</li>\n<li>don\'t share towels and socks with other people, and ensure your towels are washed regularly</li>\n<li>don\'t walk around barefoot&nbsp;in public pools, showers, and locker rooms&nbsp;&ndash; special&nbsp;shower shoes are available to protect your feet</li>\n<li>consider replacing old footwear&nbsp;as it could be the source of the infection</li>\n<li>treat athlete\'s foot&nbsp;as soon as possible to avoid the infection spreading to your nails</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Antifungal medication</h2>\n<p>Speak to your GP or pharmacist if you\'re embarrassed by the appearance of the affected nail, or it\'s causing problems such as pain and discomfort.</p>\n<p>They\'ll usually recommend treatment with antifungal medication, either in the form of tablets or a special paint you apply directly to the nail.</p>\n<p>A small sample of the infected nail may need to be&nbsp;taken and sent off for testing before treatment starts, to confirm that you do have a fungal infection.</p>\n<h3>Antifungal tablets</h3>\n<p>Terbinafine&nbsp;and itraconazole&nbsp;are the two medicines most commonly prescribed for fungal nail infections.</p>\n<p>These&nbsp;usually need to be taken&nbsp;once or twice a day for several months to ensure the infection has completely cleared up. If you stop taking&nbsp;the medication too early, the infection may return.</p>\n<p>Possible side effects of antifungal tablets can include&nbsp;<a>headache</a>, itching,&nbsp;<a>diarrhoea</a>, loss of sense of taste, and a rash.</p>\n<h3>Antifungal nail paint</h3>\n<p>If you prefer not to take antifungal tablets, your GP or pharmacist may suggest you try antifungal nail paint instead.</p>\n<p>Nail paint isn\'t generally considered to be as effective as tablets because it can be difficult for it to reach the deeper layers of the nail. However, it doesn\'t usually cause any side effects.</p>\n<p>Like antifungal tablets,&nbsp;antifungal nail paint also&nbsp;normally needs to be used for several months&nbsp;to ensure that the infection has cleared up.</p>\n<h3>Results of treatment</h3>\n<p>Antifungal treatments are thought to be effective in treating about 60-80% of fungal nail infections.&nbsp;It can take between 6&nbsp;and 18 months for the appearance of the affected nail to return to normal, and in some cases the nail may not look the same as before the infection.</p>\n<p>If the treatment is working, you should see a new healthy nail start to grow from the base of nail over the course of a few months. The old infected nail should begin to grow out and can be gradually clipped away.</p>\n<p>Speak to your GP if new, healthy nail doesn\'t start to grow after a few weeks of treatment. Keep using the treatment until your GP says you can stop, as stopping too early could result in the infection returning.</p>\n<h2>Softening and scraping&nbsp;away the nail</h2>\n<p>As it can take a long time for antifungal&nbsp;medication to work, some people may prefer to use a treatment that involves softening and removing infected parts of&nbsp;nail over a few weeks.</p>\n<p>Treatment kits are available&nbsp;from pharmacies that&nbsp;contain a 40% urea paste, plasters&nbsp;and a scraping device. The paste softens the infected parts of the nail, allowing them to be scraped away so they can be gradually replaced with healthy nail.</p>\n<p>To use the treatment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>wash the affected&nbsp;area and dry it thoroughly</li>\n<li>carefully apply the paste to the&nbsp;infected&nbsp;nails</li>\n<li>cover the nails with plasters and leave them for 24 hours</li>\n<li>wash the paste off the next day and scrape away the softened parts of the nail</li>\n<li>repeat this process each&nbsp;day for 2&nbsp;to 3&nbsp;weeks</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once no more infected parts of the nail can be removed, ask your pharmacist for antifungal nail paint to prevent re-infection as the nail regrows over&nbsp;the next few months.</p>\n<h2>Removing the nail</h2>\n<p>A procedure to remove affected nails completely isn\'t usually necessary, but may be recommended if&nbsp;the infection is severe or painful and other treatments haven\'t helped.</p>\n<p>If your nail is surgically removed, a new nail should eventually grow back in its place. However, it could take a year or more for the nail to grow back completely.</p>\n<h2>Laser&nbsp;treatment</h2>\n<p>Laser treatment is a possible option if you have a fungal nail infection that\'s&nbsp;particularly stubborn. The laser emits high doses of light energy, which are used to destroy the fungus.</p>\n<p>Early research suggests the treatment may be helpful in treating fungal nail infections, but there\'s currently not enough&nbsp;evidence to recommend it as a routine treatment.</p>\n</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(97,96,NULL,NULL,'<h2>Causes of hyperhidrosis</h2>\n<div class=\"editor\">\n<p>Hyperhidrosis can be divided into 2&nbsp;types, depending on whether an obvious cause can be identified. These are known as primary and secondary hyperhidrosis.</p>\n<h2>Primary hyperhidrosis</h2>\n<p>Hyperhidrosis that has no obvious cause is known as primary hyperhidrosis.</p>\n<p>Although it\'s not clear&nbsp;why it&nbsp;develops, it\'s thought to be the result of a problem with part of the nervous system called the sympathetic nervous system, and it\'s possible your genes may also play a role.</p>\n<h3>The sympathetic nervous system</h3>\n<p>The sympathetic nervous system controls most of your body&rsquo;s functions that do not require conscious thought, such as movement of food through your body and the movement of urine out of your kidneys and into your bladder.</p>\n<p>The sympathetic nervous system also acts like a thermostat. If it senses you are getting too hot, it will send a signal from your brain to the millions of sweat glands in your body to produce sweat. The sweat cools on your skin and reduces the temperature of your body.</p>\n<p>A specific type of sweat gland, known as the eccrine glands, appears to be involved in hyperhidrosis. There are more eccrine glands on your armpits, hands, feet and face, which may explain why these areas are often affected by hyperhidrosis.</p>\n<p>It\'s thought that in cases of primary hyperhidrosis, the brain sends signals to the eccrine glands, even though there is no need to cool the body.</p>\n<h3>Genes</h3>\n<p>Some cases of primary hyperhidrosis appear to&nbsp;run in families, which suggests a genetic mutation may be the cause.</p>\n<p>A genetic mutation is where the instructions in your cells become scrambled, which can disrupt the normal workings of the body. Some genetic mutations can be passed down from parents to their children.</p>\n<h2>Secondary hyperhidrosis</h2>\n<p>If a cause of hyperhidrosis can be identified, it\'s known as secondary hyperhidrosis.</p>\n<p>Secondary hyperhidrosis can have a number of different triggers, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>pregnancy</li>\n<li>the&nbsp;<a>menopause</a>&nbsp;&ndash; when a woman&rsquo;s monthly periods stop</li>\n<li>anxiety</li>\n<li>low blood sugar (<a>hypoglycaemia</a>)</li>\n<li>an overactive thyroid gland (<a>hyperthyroidism</a>)</li>\n<li><a >obesity</a></li>\n<li>certain medications &ndash; including some&nbsp;<a>antidepressants</a>,&nbsp;propranolol, pilocarpine, and&nbsp;bethanechol</li>\n<li>being drunk or \"high\" on drugs, or withdrawing from alcohol or drugs if you&nbsp;have become addicted to them</li>\n<li>some infections, such as&nbsp;<a>tuberculosis</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a>HIV</a></li>\n<li><a>Parkinson&rsquo;s disease</a>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>disorders of the blood cells or bone marrow, such as&nbsp;<a>Hodgkin lymphoma</a>&nbsp;(a cancer of the white blood cells)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Treating hyperhidrosis</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Hyperhidrosis can be challenging to treat and it may take a while to find the best treatment for you. Less invasive treatments will usually be recommended first.</p>\n<h2>Lifestyle changes</h2>\n<p>Changing your lifestyle cannot cure primary hyperhidrosis (hyperhidrosis with no obvious cause), but it can improve your symptoms and help your confidence.</p>\n<p>The advice below may help.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid&nbsp;triggers that you know make your sweating worse, such as spicy foods and alcohol</li>\n<li>Use antiperspirant frequently, rather than deodorant</li>\n<li>Avoid wearing tight, restrictive clothing and man-made fibres, such as nylon</li>\n<li>Wearing black or white clothing can&nbsp;minimise signs of sweating</li>\n<li>Armpit shields can absorb excessive sweat and protect your clothes</li>\n<li>Wear socks that absorb moisture, such as thick socks made of natural fibres, or special soles or sports socks designed to absorb moisture</li>\n<li>Avoid wearing socks made out of man-made materials and change your socks at least twice a day if possible</li>\n<li>Ideally wear&nbsp;shoes made of leather, and&nbsp;try to alternate between different pairs of shoes every day</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Stronger antiperspirants</h2>\n<p>If&nbsp;a regular antiperspirant doesn\'t&nbsp;control your sweating, your GP may prescribe&nbsp;or suggest&nbsp;a stronger one for you.</p>\n<p>Antiperspirant containing aluminium chloride is often used to treat hyperhidrosis. This works by plugging the sweat glands. You will need to apply it at night just before you go to sleep and wash it off in the morning.</p>\n<p>The most common side effect of aluminium chloride is mild irritation or itching and tingling where it is applied. Using the antiperspirant less frequently can help reduce irritation. Using emollients (moisturisers) regularly and soap substitutes instead of soap may also help.</p>\n<h2>Anticholinergics</h2>\n<p>You may be prescribed a type of medicine called an anticholinergic or antimuscarinic. These work by blocking the effects of a chemical called acetylcholine, which the nervous system uses to activate the sweat glands.</p>\n<p>Anticholinergics are available as tablets or solutions that are applied to affected areas. They\'re not widely used to treat hyperhidrosis and most types are not licensed to treat it, but some people find them helpful.</p>\n<p>Propantheline bromide is an anticholinergic medicine licensed for treating hyperhidrosis. However, anticholinergic medicines unlicensed for hyperhidrosis &ndash; such as oxybutynin and glycopyrronium bromide &ndash; can also be prescribed if your doctor feels they might help.</p>\n<p>Possible side effects of anticholinergics include a&nbsp;<a>dry mouth</a>, blurred vision, stomach cramps,&nbsp;<a>constipation</a>&nbsp;and difficulty passing urine.</p>\n<h2>Referral to a dermatologist</h2>\n<p>If lifestyle changes and treatment don\'t work, your GP may refer you to a dermatologist (a specialist in treating skin conditions) for further treatment, such as iontophoresis, botulinum toxin or surgery.</p>\n<h3>Iontophoresis</h3>\n<p>Iontophoresis&nbsp;may help if you have excessive sweating that affects your hands or feet. It can also be used to treat armpits, although this is usually less effective.</p>\n<p>Iontophoresis involves treating affected areas of skin with a weak electric current passed through water or a wet pad. This is thought to help block the sweat glands.</p>\n<p>If your hands and feet need treating, you place them in a bowl of water and a weak electric current is passed through the water. If your armpits need treating, a wet contact pad is placed against each armpit and a current is passed through the pad.</p>\n<p>The treatment is not painful but the electric current can cause mild, short-lived discomfort and skin irritation.</p>\n<p>Each session of iontophoresis lasts between 20 and 30 minutes, and you will usually need to have 2&nbsp;to 4&nbsp;sessions a week. Your symptoms should begin to improve after a week or 2, after which further treatment will be required at 1&nbsp;to 4&nbsp;week intervals, depending on how severe your symptoms are.</p>\n<p>Iontophoresis is often very effective, although you may need to make regular visits to your local hospital&rsquo;s dermatology clinic to receive treatment.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, iontophoresis kits that you can use at home may be recommended, with prices in the range of &pound;250-500.</p>\n<h3>Botulinum toxin injections</h3>\n<p>Botulinum toxin can be injected into the skin in areas of the body affected by hyperhidrosis. This helps reduce sweating in these areas by blocking the signals from the brain to the sweat glands.</p>\n<p>Around 15-20 injections are given in the affected areas of the body, such as the armpits, hands, feet or face. The procedure usually takes about 30-45 minutes in total.</p>\n<p>The effect of the injections usually lasts for several months, after which time the treatment can be repeated if necessary.</p>\n<p>Potential side effects of&nbsp;botulinum toxin injections include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>pain, redness or itching where the injections are given</li>\n<li>nausea, headaches and hot flushes after the injections are given</li>\n<li>another part of your body sweating more to make up for treated area &ndash; known as compensatory sweating</li>\n<li>muscle weakness around the treatment area</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most of these side effects are short-lived or will resolve as the effect of the injections wears off.</p>\n<p>Availability of botulinum toxin on the NHS can vary widely depending on your clinical commissioning group (CCG), and you may only be able to get it privately. Costs for private treatment depend on the part of the body being treated. For example, injecting the forehead can cost around &pound;150, while treating both armpits could cost up to &pound;450 or more.</p>\n<h2>Surgery and other procedures</h2>\n<p>In a few cases where hyperhidrosis is particularly severe and treatment&nbsp;hasn\'t been successful, surgery may be recommended.</p>\n<h3>Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS)</h3>\n<p>Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS) is the most widely used type of surgery to treat hyperhidrosis. It\'s usually used in cases affecting the palms or armpits.</p>\n<p>Small incisions are made in the side of the chest and the nerves that control sweating in the affected area are cut or clipped. This means signals can no longer pass along them to the sweat glands. The operation is carried out under&nbsp;<a>general anaesthetic</a>&nbsp;and done on both sides of the body.</p>\n<p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that ETS can be used to treat excessive sweating of the palms or underarms. However, before the procedure is performed, your clinician should explain:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ETS&nbsp;carries a risk of serious complications (see below)</li>\n<li>it\'s very common for excessive compensatory sweating to occur after the procedure, which causes some people to regret the procedure</li>\n<li>the procedure is not always successful at reducing sweating</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For this reason, only people with severe hyperhidrosis which hasn\'t responded to treatment should be considered.</p>\n<p>Read the full&nbsp;<a>NICE guidelines on endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy for primary hyperhidrosis of the upper limb</a>.</p>\n<p>Side effects and complications of ETS can also include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sweating of the face and neck after eating food &ndash; this is known as gustatory sweating and may affect up to half of people who have the procedure</li>\n<li>bleeding into the chest during surgery</li>\n<li>air becoming trapped inside the chest (pneumothorax), which can cause chest pain and breathing difficulties</li>\n<li>damage to the nervous system that causes&nbsp;the upper eyelid on one side of the body to droop (Horner\'s syndrome) &ndash; this may be permanent</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Removing or destroying sweat glands</h3>\n<p>Excessive sweating under the arms may occasionally be treated with a procedure to remove or destroy the sweat glands in the armpits.</p>\n<p>This can be carried out in a number of ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>making an incision in the armpit and carefully scraping away (curettage) or cutting out (Shelley&rsquo;s procedure) the sweat glands</li>\n<li>using a probe held above the skin (no incisions are needed), which emits electromagnetic radiation that destroys the sweat glands</li>\n<li>inserting a laser device under the skin through a small incision and using it to destroy the sweat glands</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These procedures are generally carried out under&nbsp;<a>local anaesthetic</a>, which means you will be awake but your armpit will be numbed.</p>\n<p>These procedures can sometimes be a permanent solution to excessive underarm sweating, although they are only carried out by a small number of practitioners. Availability on the NHS is likely to be very limited and you will probably need to pay for private treatment.</p>\n<p>These procedures don\'t work for everyone and some of them are relatively new, which means there isn\'t always evidence about their long-term safety and effectiveness.</p>\n<h2>Treating anxiety</h2>\n<p>Feelings of anxiety are not directly responsible for causing primary hyperhidrosis, but they can make the situation worse and create a vicious cycle.</p>\n<p>You may feel self-conscious, which can trigger anxiety in certain situations, such as when meeting new people or being in a crowded room. The anxiety can make the sweating worse.</p>\n<p>If your anxiety is making your sweating worse, a type of talking therapy called cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)&nbsp;might help.

The nail curls and pierces the skin, which becomes red, swollen and tender.</p>\n<p>Other possible symptoms include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>pain if pressure is placed on the toe</li>\n<li>inflammation of the skin at the end of the toe</li>\n<li>a build-up of fluid (oedema) in the area surrounding the toe</li>\n<li>an overgrowth of skin around the affected toe (hypertrophy)</li>\n<li>bleeding</li>\n<li>white or yellow pus coming from the affected area</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>When to see your GP</h2>\n<p>See your GP or podiatrist (foot care specialist) if your ingrown toenail is badly inflamed, bleeding or has pus coming from it, because it may be infected.</p>\n<p>It\'s also important to seek medical advice if you have&nbsp;diabetes and an ingrown toenail. Having diabetes could affect how your toenail heals.</p>\n<h2>What causes ingrown toenails?</h2>\n<p>A number of things can cause an ingrown toenail to develop, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>badly cut toenails &ndash; cutting your toenails too short, or cutting the edges, will encourage the skin to fold over your nail and the nail to grow into the skin</li>\n<li>wearing tight-fitting shoes, socks or tights &ndash; this places pressure on the skin around your toenail; the skin may be pierced if it\'s pressed on to your toenail</li>\n<li>sweaty feet &ndash; if the skin around your toenails is soft, it\'s easier for your nail to pierce it and embed itself within it</li>\n<li>injury &ndash; for example, stubbing your toe can sometimes cause an ingrown toenail to develop</li>\n<li>natural shape of the nail &ndash; the sides of curved or fan-shaped toenails are more likely to press into the skin surrounding the nail</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A&nbsp;<a>fungal nail infection</a>&nbsp;can cause your toenail to thicken or widen.</p>\n<h2>Treating ingrown toenails</h2>\n<p>Left untreated, an ingrown toenail can become infected, so it&rsquo;s important that you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>keep your feet clean by washing them regularly with soap and water</li>\n<li>change your socks regularly</li>\n<li>cut your toenails straight across to stop them digging into the surrounding skin</li>\n<li>gently push the skin away from the nail using a cotton bud (this may be easier after using a small amount of olive oil to soften the skin)</li>\n<li>wear comfortable shoes that fit properly</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Surgery may be recommended if your toenail doesn\'t improve. Depending on the severity of your symptoms, this may involve removing part or all of your toenail.</p>\n<h3>Partial nail avulsion</h3>\n<p>Partial nail avulsion removes part of your toenail and is the most commonly used operation for treating ingrown toenails. It\'s about 98% effective.</p>\n<p>A&nbsp;<a>local anaesthetic</a>&nbsp;is used to numb your toe and the edges of your toenail are cut away. A chemical called phenol is applied to the affected area to prevent the nail growing back and becoming ingrown in the future.</p>\n<p>A course of&nbsp;<a>antibiotics</a>&nbsp;may be prescribed if your nail is infected, and any pus will be drained away.</p>\n<h3>Total nail avulsion</h3>\n<p>Total nail avulsion completely removes your toenail. This may be necessary if your nail is thick and pressing into the skin surrounding your toe. After your toenail has been removed, you&rsquo;ll have an indentation where your nail used to be. However, it\'s perfectly safe for you not to have a toenail.</p>\n<h3>After surgery</h3>\n<p>After toenail surgery, your toe will be wrapped in a sterile bandage. This will help stem any bleeding and prevent infection. Rest your foot and keep it raised for 1&nbsp;to 2&nbsp;days after the operation.</p>\n<p>To help reduce the pain, you may need to take a painkiller, such as&nbsp;<a>paracetamol</a>, and wear soft or open-toed shoes for the first few days after surgery.</p>\n<h2>Preventing ingrown toenails</h2>\n<p>Taking care of your feet will help prevent foot problems such as ingrown toenails. It&rsquo;s important to cut your toenails properly (straight across, not at an angle or down the edges).</p>\n<p>Wash your feet every day, dry them thoroughly and use foot moisturiser. You can also use a foot file or pumice stone to remove hard or dead skin.</p>\n<p>Wearing shoes that fit properly will help to ensure your feet remain healthy. You should also change your socks (or tights) every day.</p>\n<p>Visit your GP or a podiatrist as soon as possible if you develop problems with your feet.</p>\n</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(99,98,NULL,NULL,'<h2>Causes of itching</h2>\n<p>An itch is often caused by a condition affecting the skin, but it can be a sign of a more serious underlying problem.</p>\n<p>In some cases, it may not be possible to identify a specific cause.</p>\n<h2>Skin conditions</h2>\n<p>Skin conditions that can cause itching include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>dry skin</li>\n<li><a>eczema</a>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;where the skin is dry, red, flaky and itchy</li>\n<li>contact dermatitis&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;inflammation of the skin that occurs when you come into contact with an irritant or allergen (see below)</li>\n<li><a>urticaria</a>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;also known as hives, welts or nettle rash;

These are outlined below. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Corticosteroid creams and ointments</h3>\n<p>Corticosteroid creams and ointments&nbsp;contain corticosteroids (artificial hormones) and are used to treat inflammatory skin conditions. They are often&nbsp;referred to&nbsp;as&nbsp;<a>topical corticosteroids</a>.</p>\n<p>Topical corticosteroids help treat the&nbsp;swelling (inflammation) and redness caused by lichen planus. Strong topical corticosteroids, such as clobetasol propionate, are also effective in reducing any itchiness you may have.</p>\n<p>Treatment is applied to the red or purple itchy spots, but should be stopped when the colour of the rash changes to brown or grey. This pigment change occurs when the inflammation has settled. Continuing to apply the corticosteroid cream to the brown areas of skin will&nbsp;gradually cause the skin to thin. The side effects of corticosteroids can vary, depending on the:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>type and severity of treatment being used</li>\n<li>how long the treatment is used for</li>\n<li>nature of the condition being treated</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Potential side effects of topical corticosteroids can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>redness or burning and stinging of the skin</li>\n<li>skin rash</li>\n<li>thinning of the skin (atrophy)</li>\n<li>stretch marks (striae)&nbsp;</li>\n<li>contact dermatitis &ndash; a condition that causes skin inflammation</li>\n<li>excessive hair growth (hypertrichosis)</li>\n<li>lightening of the skin</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Always check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine.</p>\n<h3>Corticosteroid tablets</h3>\n<p><a>Corticosteroid tablets</a>&nbsp;are sometimes used to treat severe cases of lichen planus, when the symptoms aren\'t being effectively controlled with creams or ointments.</p>\n<p>Possible side effects of corticosteroid tablets used on a short-term basis can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>increased appetite</li>\n<li>weight gain</li>\n<li><a>insomnia</a></li>\n<li>fluid retention (inability to pass urine)</li>\n<li>mood changes, such as feeling irritable or anxious</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Other treatments</h3>\n<p>Other treatments&nbsp;recommended for lichen planus of the skin are outlined below.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Antihistamines &ndash; these are often used to treat symptoms of&nbsp;<a>allergies</a>, such as itchy skin. If you have lichen planus of the skin that\'s causing itchiness, antihistamines may be prescribed to help reduce this.</li>\n<li>Light treatment &ndash; there are 2&nbsp;types of light treatment: ultraviolet B (UVB) and psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA). UVB is the most commonly used light treatment, but PUVA may be recommended in severe or widespread cases of lichen planus that don\'t respond to other types of treatment.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Acitretin &ndash; this medication is only prescribed by a specialist and is used to treat severe cases of lichen planus. The tablets have some associated side effects and may not mix well with other medicines. Your specialist can offer advice.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Lichen planus of the mouth (oral lichen planus)</h2>\n<p>Mild cases of oral lichen planus won\'t need any treatment. In more severe cases, treatment includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a mouthwash that contains an anaesthetic to temporarily numb the mouth, which makes eating easier</li>\n<li>corticosteroid sprays, mouthwashes, pastes and dissolvable lozenges</li>\n<li>a mouthwash or gel that contains an antiseptic to help prevent the build-up of plaque in your mouth</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In more severe cases of oral lichen planus, corticosteroid tablets may also be used on a short-term basis.</p>\n<p>It can be difficult to prevent oral lichen planus, but to keep the lining of your mouth healthy it\'s recommended that you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a>stop&nbsp;smoking</a>&nbsp;(if you smoke)</li>\n<li>avoid drinking large amounts of&nbsp;<a>alcohol</a></li>\n<li>have a&nbsp;<a>healthy, balanced diet</a>, including plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should also maintain&nbsp;<a>good oral hygiene</a>&nbsp;by cleaning your teeth at least&nbsp;twice a day, and having regular&nbsp;<a>dental check-ups</a>,&nbsp;so that any problems with your teeth or mouth&nbsp;can be identified and treated early.</p>\n<h2>Other treatments</h2>\n<p>If corticosteroids are not effective in treating your symptoms, you may be prescribed a medication that suppresses your immune system to try to limit the autoimmune reaction that\'s thought to cause lichen planus.</p>\n<p>These types of treatments are known as immunomodulating agents. Depending on which area of your body is affected by lichen planus, treatments that may be recommended for you can include: treatments such as tacrolimus&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>topical immunomodulating agents&nbsp;(used to treat lichen planus of the skin) &ndash; treatments such as tacrolimus&nbsp;ointment and&nbsp;pimecrolimus cream are rubbed directly onto the skin</li>\n<li>immunomodulating agents&nbsp;(used to treat lichen planus of the mouth) &ndash; these are usually available in the form of tablets or capsules, and can be used to treat severe cases of oral lichen planus</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These treatments can cause&nbsp;a number of different side effects, which your specialist can discuss with you.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(101,100,NULL,NULL,'<h2>Symptoms of pressure ulcers</h2>\n<p>The parts of the body most at risk of developing pressure ulcers are those that are not covered by a large amount of body fat and are in direct contact with a supporting surface, such as a bed or a wheelchair.</p>\n<p>For example, if you are unable to get out of bed, you are at risk of developing pressure ulcers on your:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>shoulders or shoulder blades</li>\n<li>elbows</li>\n<li>back of your head</li>\n<li>rims of your ears</li>\n<li>knees, ankles, heels or toes</li>\n<li>spine</li>\n<li>tail bone (the small bone at the bottom of your spine)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are a wheelchair user, you are at risk of developing pressure ulcers on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>your buttocks</li>\n<li>the back of your arms and legs</li>\n<li>the back of your hip bone</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Severity&nbsp;of pressure ulcers</h2>\n<p>Healthcare professionals use several grading systems to describe the severity of pressure ulcers. The most common is the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP) grading system. The higher the grade, the more severe the injury to the skin and underlying tissue.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Grade&nbsp;1</h3>\n<p>A grade 1&nbsp;pressure ulcer is the most superficial type of ulcer. The affected area of skin appears discoloured &ndash; it is red in white people, and purple or blue in people with darker-coloured skin. Grade 1&nbsp;pressure ulcers do not turn white when pressure is placed on them. The skin remains intact, but it may hurt or itch. It may also&nbsp;feel either warm and spongy, or hard.</p>\n<h3>Grade&nbsp;2</h3>\n<p>In grade 2&nbsp;pressure ulcers, some of the outer surface of the skin (the epidermis) or the deeper layer of skin (the dermis) is damaged, leading to skin loss. The ulcer looks like an open wound or a blister.</p>\n<h3>Grade&nbsp;3</h3>\n<p>In grade 3&nbsp;pressure ulcers, skin loss occurs throughout the entire thickness of the skin. The underlying tissue is also damaged, although the underlying muscle and bone are not. The ulcer appears as a deep, cavity-like wound.</p>\n<h3>Grade&nbsp;4</h3>\n<p>A grade 4&nbsp;pressure ulcer is the most severe type of pressure ulcer. The skin is severely damaged and the surrounding tissue begins to die (tissue necrosis). The underlying muscles or bone may also be damaged.</p>\n<p>People with grade 4&nbsp;pressure ulcers have a high risk of developing a life-threatening infection.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Treating pressure ulcers</h2>\n<p>Treatment for pressure ulcers can vary, depending on the grade of the ulcer. Treatment options may include regularly changing your position, or using special mattresses and dressings to relieve pressure or protect the skin. In some cases, surgery may be needed.</p>\n<h2>Your care team</h2>\n<p>Pressure ulcers are a complex health problem arising from many interrelated factors. Therefore, your care may be provided by a team comprising different types of healthcare professionals. This type of team is sometimes known as a multidisciplinary team (MDT).</p>\n<p>Your MDT may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a tissue viability nurse (a nurse who specialises in wound care and prevention)</li>\n<li>a social worker</li>\n<li>a physiotherpist</li>\n<li>an&nbsp;<a>occupational therapist</a></li>\n<li>a dietitian</li>\n<li>medical and surgical experts with experience in pressure ulcer management</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Changing position</h2>\n<p>It\'s important to avoid putting pressure on areas that are vulnerable to pressure ulcers or where pressure ulcers have already formed. Moving and regularly changing your position helps to prevent pressure ulcers developing and relieves the pressure on&nbsp;the ulcers that have developed.</p>\n<p>After your risk assessment is completed, your care team will draw up a \"repositioning timetable\", which states how often you need to be moved. For some people, this may be as often as once every 15 minutes. Others may need to be moved only once every 2&nbsp;hours.</p>\n<p>The risk assessment will also consider the most effective way of avoiding putting any vulnerable areas of skin under pressure whenever possible.</p>\n<p>You may also be given training and advice about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>correct sitting and lying positions</li>\n<li>how you can adjust your sitting and lying position</li>\n<li>how often you need to move or be moved</li>\n<li>how best to support your feet</li>\n<li>how to maintain good posture</li>\n<li>the special equipment you should use and how to use it</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Mattresses and cushions</h2>\n<p>There are a range of special mattresses and cushions that can relieve pressure on vulnerable parts of the body. Your care team will discuss the types of mattresses and cushions most suitable for you.</p>\n<p>Those&nbsp;thought to be at risk of developing pressure ulcers, or who have pre-existing grade 1&nbsp;or 2&nbsp;pressure ulcers, usually benefit from a&nbsp;specially designed foam mattress, which relieves the pressure on their body.</p>\n<p>People with a grade 3&nbsp;or 4&nbsp;pressure ulcer will require a more sophisticated mattress or bed system. For example, there are mattresses that can be connected to a constant flow of air, which is automatically regulated to reduce pressure as and when required.</p>\n<h2>Dressings</h2>\n<p>Specially designed dressings and bandages&nbsp;can be used to protect pressure ulcers and speed up the healing process. Examples of these types of dressings include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>hydrocolloid dressings &ndash;&nbsp;these contain a special gel that encourages the growth of new skin cells in the ulcer, while keeping the surrounding healthy area of skin dry&nbsp;</li>\n<li>alginate dressings &ndash;&nbsp;these are made from seaweed and contain sodium and calcium, which are known to speed up the healing process</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Creams and ointments</h2>\n<p>Topical preparations, such as creams and ointments, can be used to help speed up the healing process and prevent further tissue damage.</p>\n<h2>Antibiotics</h2>\n<p>If you have a pressure ulcer, you will not routinely be prescribed antibiotics. These are usually only prescribed to treat an infected pressure ulcer and prevent the infection from spreading.</p>\n<p>Antiseptic cream may also be applied directly to pressure ulcers to clear out any bacteria that may be present.</p>\n<h2>Nutrition</h2>\n<p>Certain dietary supplements, such as protein, zinc and vitamin C, have been shown to accelerate wound healing.</p>\n<p>If your diet lacks these vitamins and minerals, your skin may be more vulnerable to developing pressure ulcers. As a result of this, you may be referred to a dietitian so that a suitable dietary plan can be drawn up for you.</p>\n<h2>Debridement</h2>\n<p>In some cases, it may be necessary to remove dead tissue from the ulcer to help stimulate the healing process. This procedure is known as debridement.</p>\n<p>If there is a small amount of dead tissue, it may be possible to remove it using specially designed dressings and paste. Larger amounts of dead tissue may be removed using mechanical means. Some mechanical debridement techniques include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>cleansing and pressure irrigation &ndash;&nbsp;where dead tissue is removed using high-pressure water jets</li>\n<li>ultrasound &ndash; dead tissue is removed using low-frequency energy waves</li>\n<li>laser &ndash;&nbsp;dead tissue is removed using focused beams of light</li>\n<li>surgical debridement &ndash;&nbsp;dead tissue is removed using surgical instruments, such as scalpels and forceps</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A&nbsp;<a>local anaesthetic</a>&nbsp;will be used to numb the area of skin and tissue around the ulcer so that debridement does not cause any pain or discomfort.</p>\n<h2>Maggot therapy</h2>\n<p>Maggot therapy, also known as larvae therapy, is an alternative method of debridement. Maggots are ideal for debridement because they feed on dead and infected tissue without touching healthy tissue. They also help to fight infection by releasing substances that kill bacteria and stimulate the healing process.</p>\n<p>During maggot therapy, the maggots are mixed into a wound dressing and the area is covered with gauze. After a few days, the dressing is taken off and the maggots are removed.</p>\n<p>Many people may find the idea of maggot therapy off-putting, but research has found that it is often more effective than more traditional methods of debridement.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Surgery</h2>\n<p>It\'s not always possible for a grade 3&nbsp;or 4&nbsp;pressure ulcer to heal. In such cases, surgery will be required to seal the wound and prevent any further tissue damage occurring.</p>\n<p>Surgical treatment involves cleaning the wound and closing it by bringing together the edges of the wound (direct closure), or by using tissue moved from a nearby part of the body (flap reconstruction).</p>\n<p>Pressure ulcer surgery can be challenging, especially because most people who have the procedure are already in a poor state of health. There is a risk of a large number of possible complications occurring after surgery, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>infection</li>\n<li>tissue death of the implanted flap</li>\n<li>muscle weakness</li>\n<li><a>blisters&nbsp;</a>(small pockets of fluid that develop inside the skin)</li>\n<li>recurrence of the pressure ulcers</li>\n<li>blood poisoning</li>\n<li>infection of the bone (osteomyelitis)</li>\n<li>internal bleeding</li>\n<li>abscesses&nbsp;(painful collections of pus that develop inside the body)</li>\n<li><a>deep vein thrombosis</a>&nbsp;(a blood clot that develops inside the veins of the leg)</li>\n</ul>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(102,101,NULL,NULL,'<h2>Symptoms of rosacea</h2>\n<p>Rosacea causes a range of symptoms, although not everyone will experience them all.</p>\n<p>Most people with rosacea have periods when their symptoms are particularly troublesome, followed by periods&nbsp;when their symptoms are less so.</p>\n<p>The main symptoms of rosacea include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>flushing</li>\n<li>persistent facial redness</li>\n<li>visible blood vessels</li>\n<li>papules and pustules</li>\n<li>thickened skin</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are discussed in more detail below.</p>\n<p>Other symptoms associated with rosacea include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sensitive skin&nbsp;&ndash; burning, itching, stinging and&nbsp;pain</li>\n<li>dry, rough skin</li>\n<li>raised red patches (plaques) on your skin</li>\n<li>facial swelling&nbsp;<a>(lymphoedema)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Permanent damage to the face (scarring) almost never occurs in rosacea.</p>\n<h2>Flushing</h2>\n<p>Flushing&nbsp;is when your skin turns red for a short period&nbsp;&ndash; usually a few minutes. It tends to mainly affect the face, although it can spread to your neck and chest.</p>\n<p>In some cases the redness may be accompanied by an unpleasant feeling of heat.</p>\n<p>In rosacea flushing&nbsp;is often caused by a certain trigger, such as sun exposure, hot drinks or exercise. See&nbsp;<a>causes of rosacea</a>&nbsp;for more information about possible triggers.</p>\n<h2>Persistent facial redness</h2>\n<p>Persistent facial redness (erythema) is&nbsp;like&nbsp;a blush or a patch of sunburn that doesn\'t go away, or the sort of blotchy skin often associated with drinking too much alcohol.</p>\n<p>This can be upsetting for those with rosacea as people can mistakenly assume they are heavy drinkers.</p>\n<p>The redness usually affects the cheeks, nose and chin, but may spread to other areas, such as the forehead, neck and chest.</p>\n<h2>Visible blood vessels</h2>\n<p>Over time the blood vessels in the skin may become permanently widened&nbsp;(dilated) and visible. The medical name for visible blood vessels is telangiectasia.</p>\n<h2>Papules and pustules</h2>\n<p>If you have rosacea, you may develop round red bumps that rise from your skin (papules) and pus-filled swellings&nbsp;(pustules).</p>\n<p>These spots appear on your face and are similar to&nbsp;<a>acne</a>. Rosacea used to be called acne rosacea, but the 2&nbsp;conditions are quite different.</p>\n<p>In rosacea there are no blackheads&nbsp;and&nbsp;the skin is not greasy, but dry and peeling. Rosacea spots also don\'t cause scarring.</p>\n<h2>Thickened skin</h2>\n<p>In the most serious cases of rosacea the skin can thicken and form excess tissue, usually around the nose. This causes the nose to take on a large, bulbous appearance (rhinophyma).</p>\n<p>Rhinophyma is an uncommon,&nbsp;severe&nbsp;symptom of rosacea and takes several years to develop. It&nbsp;almost exclusively affects men.</p>\n<h2>Treating rosacea</h2>\n<p>Although rosacea can\'t be cured, treatment can help keep the symptoms under control.</p>\n<p>Long-term treatment is usually necessary, although there may be periods where your symptoms improve and you can stop treatment temporarily.</p>\n<p>Treatment choices depend on&nbsp;which type of symptom is most troublesome, but usually involves a combination of&nbsp;self-help measures and medication, and are&nbsp;outlined below.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Self-help measures</h2>\n<p>There are a number of&nbsp;things you can do yourself to help keep the symptoms of rosacea under control, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>avoiding things that trigger your symptoms &ndash; for example, by using sun cream and covering yourself up if direct sunlight makes your symptoms worse</li>\n<li>taking good care of your skin &ndash; for example, by&nbsp;using&nbsp;products suitable for sensitive skin</li>\n<li>using make-up &ndash;&nbsp;patches of persistent red skin can be disguised using specially designed camouflage make-up</li>\n<li>keeping your eyelids clean &ndash; if rosacea is causing your eyelids to become inflamed (blepharitis)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Treating papules and pustules</h2>\n<p>If you have&nbsp;round red bumps that rise from your skin (papules) and pus-filled swellings (pustules) caused by rosacea, there are a number of different medications that can be effective.</p>\n<p>These can be divided into topical treatments that are applied to the skin, or oral treatments, which are taken by mouth.</p>\n<h3>Topical treatments</h3>\n<p>Topical medications are usually prescribed first. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>metronidazole cream or gel</li>\n<li>azelaic acid cream or gel</li>\n<li>ivermectin cream</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ivermectin is a relatively new medicine. There\'s some evidence to suggest it may be more effective and perhaps less irritating to the skin than metronidazole, although it\'s not currently available on the NHS everywhere and may only be recommended if the other treatments don\'t work.</p>\n<p>You\'ll usually need to apply these topical treatments once or twice a day, taking care not to get them in your eyes or mouth. It may be several weeks before you notice any significant improvement in your symptoms.</p>\n<p>Side effects of these treatments can include a burning or stinging sensation, itchiness and dry skin.</p>\n<h3>Oral antibiotics</h3>\n<p>If your symptoms are more severe, an oral&nbsp;<a>antibiotic</a>&nbsp;medication may be recommended as these can help reduce&nbsp;inflammation of the skin.</p>\n<p>Antibiotics often used to treat rosacea include tetracycline, oxytetracycline, doxycycline and erythromycin.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These medications are usually taken for 4&nbsp;to 6&nbsp;weeks, but longer courses may be necessary if the spots are persistent.</p>\n<p>For example, a low-dose doxycycline capsule is available if oral antibiotics need to be taken long term.</p>\n<p>Common side effects of these medications include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>feeling and being sick</li>\n<li><a>diarrhoea</a></li>\n<li>bloating and&nbsp;<a>indigestion</a></li>\n<li><a>tummy (abdominal)&nbsp;pain</a></li>\n<li>loss of appetite</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of the medications used can also&nbsp;make your skin sensitive to sunlight and artificial sources of light, such as sun lamps and sunbeds.</p>\n<p>As with the topical treatments mentioned above, these medications usually need to be taken&nbsp;once or twice a day and you may not notice a significant improvement in your symptoms for several weeks.</p>\n<h2>Oral&nbsp;isotretinoin</h2>\n<p>Isotretinoin is a medicine often used to treat severe&nbsp;<a>acne</a>,&nbsp;but at lower doses it\'s also occasionally used to treat rosacea.</p>\n<p>As isotretinoin is a strong medication that can cause a range of side effects, it can only be prescribed by a&nbsp;specialist&nbsp;in treating skin conditions (dermatologist) and not your GP.</p>\n<p>Common side effects of isotretinoin include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>dryness and cracking of the skin, lips and nostrils</li>\n<li>inflammation of your eyelids (blepharitis) or&nbsp;eyes&nbsp;<a>(conjunctivitis)</a></li>\n<li><a>headaches</a></li>\n<li>muscle or&nbsp;joint pain</li>\n<li>back pain</li>\n<li>blood in your urine (haematuria)</li>\n<li>mood changes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Isotretinion can also cause birth defects if taken during pregnancy.</p>\n<h2>Treating facial redness</h2>\n<p>Treating&nbsp;facial redness and&nbsp;flushing caused by rosacea&nbsp;is generally more difficult than treating papules and pustules caused by the condition.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But as well as&nbsp;the self-help measures mentioned above, there are some medications that can help.</p>\n<h3>Brimonidine tartrate</h3>\n<p>Brimonidine tartrate is a relatively new medication for facial redness caused by rosacea. It comes in the form of a&nbsp;gel that\'s applied to the face once a day.</p>\n<p>The medication works by restricting the widening (dilation) of the blood vessels in your face. Research&nbsp;has shown it can start to have an effect about 30 minutes after it\'s first used, and this can last for around 12 hours.</p>\n<p>Common side effects of&nbsp;brimonidine tartrate include itchiness and a burning sensation where the gel is applied.</p>\n<p>Less common side effects can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a dry mouth</li>\n<li>headaches</li>\n<li>pins and needles</li>\n<li>dry skin</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A rebound effect, where flushing becomes worse, has also been reported with this medication.</p>\n<h3>Oral treatments</h3>\n<p>Alternatively, there are a number of oral medications that may help improve redness caused by rosacea.</p>\n<p>These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>clonidine&nbsp;&ndash; a medication that relaxes the blood vessels</li>\n<li><a>beta-blockers</a>&nbsp;&ndash; medications that decrease the activity of the heart</li>\n<li>anxiety medications&nbsp;&ndash; medications sometimes used to help calm the person and reduce blushing&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It\'s not clear how effective these medications are at treating redness caused by rosacea, but they may sometimes be prescribed under the supervision of a dermatologist.</p>\n<h3>Laser and intense pulsed light (IPL) treatment</h3>\n<p>Redness and visible blood vessels (telangiectasia) can also sometimes be successfully improved with vascular laser or intense pulsed light (IPL) treatment. These treatments may also improve flushing.</p>\n<p>A referral to a dermatologist is usually required before having these treatments and they\'re not usually available on the NHS, so you may need to pay for them privately. Around 2&nbsp;to 4&nbsp;treatments may be needed, so the overall cost may be significant.</p>\n<p>Laser and IPL machines produce narrow beams of light that are aimed at the visible blood vessels in the skin. The heat from the lasers damages the dilated veins and causes them to shrink so they\'re no longer visible, with minimal scarring or damage to the&nbsp;surrounding area.</p>\n<p>Laser treatment can cause pain, but most people don\'t need an anaesthetic. Side effects of laser treatment are usually mild and can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>bruising</li>\n<li>crusting of the skin</li>\n<li>swelling and redness of the skin</li>\n<li><a>blisters</a>&nbsp;(in rare cases)</li>\n<li>infection (in very rare cases)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These side effects usually only last a few days and are rarely permanent.</p>\n<h2>Treating thickened skin</h2>\n<p>In some people with rosacea the skin of the nose can become thickened. This is known as&nbsp;rhinophyma.</p>\n<p>If you have severe rhinophyma, your GP may refer you to a dermatologist or plastic surgeon to&nbsp;discuss&nbsp;ways the appearance of your skin can be improved.</p>\n<p>A number of surgical treatments are available to remove any excess tissue and remodel the nose into a more pleasing shape.</p>\n<p>This may be done with a&nbsp;laser, a scalpel or specially designed abrasive instruments using a technique called dermabrasion.</p>\n<h2>Treating eye problems</h2>\n<p>If rosacea&nbsp;is affecting your eyes (ocular rosacea), you may require further treatment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For example, you may need to use lubricating eye drops or ointment if you have dry eyes, or oral antibiotics if you have blepharitis.</p>\n<p>If&nbsp;initial treatment isn\'t&nbsp;effective or you develop any further problems with your eyes, you\'ll need to be referred to an eye specialist called an ophthalmologist for further assessment and treatment.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(103,102,NULL,NULL,'<h2>Symptoms of scabies</h2>\n<p>The main symptoms of scabies are intense itching and a rash in areas of the body where the mites have burrowed.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<a>itching</a>&nbsp;is often worse at night, when your skin is warmer.&nbsp;It may take 4&nbsp;to 6&nbsp;weeks before the itching starts because this is how long it takes for the body to react to mite droppings.</p>\n<p>Symptoms will start within 1&nbsp;to 2&nbsp;days if you\'ve had a scabies&nbsp;infection in the past. This is because your immune system will have learned to respond to a scabies infection.</p>\n<h2>The rash</h2>\n<p>The scabies&nbsp;rash consists of tiny red&nbsp;spots. Scratching the rash may cause crusty sores to develop.</p>\n<p>Burrow marks can be found anywhere on the body. They\'re short (1cm or less), wavy, silver-coloured lines on the skin, with a black dot at one end that can be seen with a magnifying glass.</p>\n<p>In adults, burrow marks often appear in the following areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the folds of skin between&nbsp;fingers and toes</li>\n<li>the palms of the hands</li>\n<li>the soles and sides of the feet&nbsp;</li>\n<li>the wrists</li>\n<li>the elbows</li>\n<li>around the&nbsp;nipples (in women)</li>\n<li>around the genital area (in men)&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The rash usually affects the whole body, apart from the head.&nbsp;The following areas can be particularly affected:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the underarm area</li>\n<li>around the waist</li>\n<li>the inside of the elbow</li>\n<li>the lower buttocks</li>\n<li>the lower legs</li>\n<li>the soles of the feet</li>\n<li>the&nbsp;knees</li>\n<li>the shoulder blades</li>\n<li>the female genital area</li>\n<li>the groin</li>\n<li>around the ankles</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Elderly people, young children and those with a low immune system (immunocompromised) may also develop a rash on their head and neck.</p>\n<p>Men usually have 1&nbsp;or more very itchy, lumpy, 3 to 10mm spots on the skin of the genitals (on the penis&nbsp;and scrotum).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In infants and young children, burrow marks tend to appear in different&nbsp;places on their body, including on&nbsp;the:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>face</li>\n<li>head</li>\n<li>neck</li>\n<li>scalp</li>\n<li>palms of the hands</li>\n<li>soles of the feet</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Scabies mites leave small red blotches and silver-coloured lines on the skin. These marks are caused by the mites burrowing into the skin.</p>\n<p>In infants with scabies, blisters and pustules (small blisters that contain pus) may develop on&nbsp;the soles of the feet and palms of the hands.</p>\n<h2>Causes of scabies</h2>\n<p>Scabies is a skin condition caused by the parasite Sarcoptes scabiei.</p>\n<p>The intense&nbsp;<a>itching</a>&nbsp;associated with scabies is thought to be caused by the immune system reacting to the mites and their saliva, eggs and faeces.</p>\n<h2>The scabies mite life cycle</h2>\n<p>A scabies infestation starts when a female mite burrows into your skin.</p>\n<p>Male mites move between different burrow sites looking to mate. After mating, the male mite dies and the female begins to lay eggs, which&nbsp;hatch around 3&nbsp;to 4&nbsp;days later.</p>\n<p>After hatching, the young mites move to the surface of the skin, where they mature into adults after 10 to 15 days. Male mites stay on the surface of the skin, while&nbsp;female mites burrow back into the skin to create a new burrow. The life cycle is then repeated.</p>\n<p>Without effective treatment, the life cycle of the scabies mite can continue indefinitely. Scabies mites are resistant to soap and hot water and can\'t be scrubbed out of the skin.</p>\n<h2>How scabies is spread</h2>\n<p>Scabies mites can\'t fly or jump, which means they can only move from one human body to another if 2&nbsp;people have direct and prolonged physical contact.</p>\n<p>For example, scabies mites can be transmitted by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>holding hands with an&nbsp;infected person for a prolonged period of time</li>\n<li>having sex with an&nbsp;infected person&nbsp;</li>\n<li>sharing&nbsp;clothing, towels and bedding with an infected person (although&nbsp;this is rare)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It\'s unlikely that scabies will be transmitted through brief physical contact, such as shaking hands or hugging.</p>\n<p>Scabies mites can survive outside the human body for 24 to 36 hours, making infection by coming into contact with contaminated clothes, towels&nbsp;or bed linen a possibility. However, it\'s&nbsp;rare for someone to be infected in this way.</p>\n<p>Scabies infestations can spread quickly because people are usually unaware&nbsp;they&nbsp;have the condition until 2&nbsp;to 3&nbsp;weeks after the initial infection.</p>\n<p>There\'s an increased risk of catching scabies in confined environments, such as schools and nursing homes, where people are in close proximity to one another.</p>\n<h2>Treating scabies</h2>\n<div class=\"editor\">\n<p>See your GP immediately if you have scabies and you haven\'t had a previous infection. Delaying treatment places other people at risk.</p>\n<p>As other more serious skin conditions can sometimes cause similar symptoms to the&nbsp;<a>symptoms of scabies</a>, your GP will need to rule these out.</p>\n<p>If you have scabies, your partner will also need to be treated regardless of whether or not they have any symptoms. This is because it\'s highly likely that scabies will have been transmitted through close bodily contact, such as during&nbsp;sex.</p>\n<p>To reduce the risk of reinfection, avoid having sex and other forms of prolonged close bodily contact, such as holding hands,&nbsp;until both you and your partner have completed&nbsp;the&nbsp;full course of treatment.</p>\n<p>If you\'ve been diagnosed with scabies, you may be advised to visit your&nbsp;<a>nearest sexual health clinic</a>&nbsp;to be checked and, if necessary, treated for other&nbsp;<a>sexually transmitted infections (STIs)</a>.</p>\n<h2>Lotions and creams</h2>\n<p>Lotions and creams are commonly used to treat scabies. Your GP, pharmacist or nurse will be able to advise you about which treatment to use.</p>\n<h3>Applying the cream or lotion</h3>\n<p>To prevent reinfection, all members of your household and any close contacts, including recent sexual partners (see&nbsp;<a>diagnosing scabies</a>&nbsp;for further details), should be&nbsp;treated at the same time as you, even if they don\'t have any symptoms.</p>\n<p>The cream or lotion should be applied to the&nbsp;skin of&nbsp;all of your body, except your head.&nbsp;Before you apply it, make sure your skin is&nbsp;cool and dry. Don\'t apply it after having a hot bath.</p>\n<p>If you apply it when your body is hot, it will quickly be absorbed into your skin and won\'t remain on the area where the scabies burrows are.</p>\n<p>You should also follow the advice outlined below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Read the patient leaflet that comes with the cream or lotion for details of where to apply it. Some products need to be applied to the whole body, including the scalp and face, whereas others must only be applied from the neck down</li>\n<li>Pay particular attention to difficult-to-reach areas, such as your back, the soles of your feet, in between your fingers and toes, under fingernails, and on your genitals&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Use a cotton bud or old toothbrush to apply the treatment under&nbsp;fingernails and toenails. Put the cotton bud or toothbrush in a bag and throw it away&nbsp;afterwards</li>\n<li>Leave the treatment on your skin for 8 to 24 hours (depending on the preparation used) before washing it off thoroughly. Follow the manufacturer\'s instructions regarding how long to leave the cream or lotion on for</li>\n<li>Reapply the cream or lotion&nbsp;immediately to any areas of skin that are washed during the period of application</li>\n<li>Wash bed linen, nightwear and towels after the first application</li>\n<li>Repeat the treatment process 7&nbsp;days after the first application to ensure&nbsp;it\'s successful. The second application will ensure any mites hatched from existing eggs are killed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Contact your GP if the&nbsp;<a>itching</a>&nbsp;hasn\'t improved after 2&nbsp;weeks of treatment&nbsp;and you notice new burrows on your skin.</p>\n<p>It can take a month after treatment for the general itching to subside completely, and longer for the lumpy genital lesions to resolve. Your GP may recommend repeating the&nbsp;treatment or they may prescribe a different lotion.</p>\n<p>You should also speak to&nbsp;your GP or pharmacist if you experience any persistent side effects.</p>\n<h2>Infection control</h2>\n<p>On the day you first apply the cream or lotion, you should&nbsp;wash all bed linen, nightwear&nbsp;and towels at&nbsp;a temperature above 50C (122F).</p>\n<p>If you\'re unable to wash certain items,&nbsp;place them in a plastic bag for at least 72 hours. After this time, the scabies&nbsp;mites will have died.</p>\n<p>In cases of crusted scabies, you should clean&nbsp;the floors in your house and thoroughly vacuum your carpets&nbsp;and furniture, including the armchairs and sofa.</p>\n<p>If you\'ve been diagnosed with scabies,&nbsp;avoid close and prolonged physical contact with others until you\'ve applied the cream or lotion. You should also&nbsp;avoid close contact with other members of your household until their treatment has been completed.</p>\n<p>Children and adults can return to school or work after the first treatment&nbsp;has been completed.</p>\n<h2>Itchiness</h2>\n<p>Your GP should be able to prescribe treatments, such as a mild steroid cream,&nbsp;to reduce the itchiness. Menthol cream or gel, available&nbsp;from pharmacies without a prescription, may also&nbsp;help relieve itchy skin.</p>\n<p>Oral&nbsp;sedative antihistamines are also available from your local pharmacy and can be used to control itching and help you get a better night\'s sleep.</p>\n<p>As this type of antihistamine can cause drowsiness, you should avoid driving or operating heavy machinery if you\'re affected in this way.</p>\n<p>Non-sedating antihistamines don\'t help relieve the itching of scabies.&nbsp;Check with your GP or pharmacist&nbsp;if you\'re&nbsp;unsure.</p>\n<p>You may continue to experience itchiness for a couple of weeks after your treatment has been completed. This is because your immune system will still be reacting to the presence of dead mites and their droppings.</p>\n<p>Visit your GP if you\'re still experiencing itchiness 6&nbsp;weeks after completing&nbsp;your treatment.</p>\n</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(104,103,NULL,NULL,'<h2>Symptoms of appendicitis</h2>\n\n<p>Appendicitis typically starts with a pain in the middle of your tummy (abdomen) that may come and go.</p>\n<p>Within hours, the pain travels to your lower right-hand side, where the appendix is usually located, and becomes constant and severe.</p>\n<p>Pressing on this area, coughing, or walking may all make the pain worse.</p>\n<p>If you have appendicitis, you may also have other symptoms, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>feeling sick (nausea)</li>\n<li>being sick</li>\n<li>loss of appetite</li>\n<li><a>diarrhoea</a></li>\n<li>a high temperature (fever) and a flushed face</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>When to get medical help</h2>\n<p>If you\'re experiencing&nbsp;abdominal pain that\'s gradually getting worse, contact your GP or&nbsp;<a>local&nbsp;out-of-hours service</a>&nbsp;immediately.

These are signs your appendix may have burst.</p>\n<p>If the appendix bursts, it can cause&nbsp;peritonitis, a potentially serious infection of the inner lining of the abdomen.</p>\n<h2>Diagnosing appendicitis</h2>\n<p>Appendicitis can be tricky to diagnose unless you have the typical symptoms, which are only present in about half of all cases.</p>\n<p>Also, some people\'s appendixes may be located in a slightly different part of their body, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the pelvis</li>\n<li>behind the large intestine</li>\n<li>around the small bowel</li>\n<li>near the right lower part of the liver</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some people develop pain similar to appendicitis, but it\'s caused by something else, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a>gastroenteritis</a></li>\n<li>severe&nbsp;<a>irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)</a></li>\n<li><a>constipation</a></li>\n<li>a bladder or&nbsp;<a>urine infection</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your GP will ask about your symptoms, examine your abdomen, and see if the pain gets worse when pressure is applied to the appendix area (your lower right-hand side).</p>\n<p>If your symptoms are typical of appendicitis, this is normally enough for your GP to make a confident diagnosis. In&nbsp;this case, you\'ll immediately be referred to hospital for treatment.</p>\n<h2>Further tests</h2>\n<p>If your symptoms aren\'t typical, further tests may be required in hospital to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.</p>\n<p>Further tests may involve:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a&nbsp;<a>blood test</a>&nbsp;to look for signs of infection</li>\n<li>a pregnancy test&nbsp;for women</li>\n<li>a urine test to rule out other conditions, such as a bladder infection</li>\n<li>an&nbsp;<a>ultrasound scan</a>&nbsp;to see if the appendix is swollen</li>\n<li>a&nbsp;<a>computerised tomography (CT) scan</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It can sometimes take&nbsp;time to get test results. Your surgeon may recommend a laparoscopy to inspect your appendix and pelvic organs if the diagnosis is still uncertain.</p>\n<p>You\'ll usually&nbsp;be advised to have your appendix removed if appendicitis is suspected, rather than run the risk of it bursting. This means some people will have their appendix removed even though it\'s eventually found to be normal.</p>\n<p>In some cases where a diagnosis is not certain, a doctor may recommend waiting up to 24 hours to see if your symptoms improve, stay the same, or get worse.</p>\n<p>If your doctor suspects your appendix has burst, you\'ll be sent to hospital immediately for treatment.</p>\n<h2>Treating appendicitis</h2>\n<div class=\"editor\">\n<p>If you have appendicitis, your appendix usually needs to be removed as soon as possible. This operation is known as an appendectomy or appendicectomy.</p>\n<p>Surgery is usually&nbsp;also recommended if there\'s a chance you have appendicitis but it\'s not been possible to make a clear diagnosis.</p>\n<p>This is because it\'s considered safer to remove the appendix than run the risk of the appendix bursting.</p>\n<p>In humans, the appendix doesn\'t perform any important function and having it removed doesn\'t cause any long-term problems.</p>\n<h2>The procedure</h2>\n<p>Appendectomies are carried out under&nbsp;<a>general anaesthetic</a>&nbsp;using either a keyhole or open technique.</p>\n<h3>Keyhole surgery</h3>\n<p>Keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) is usually the preferred method of removing the appendix because the recovery tends to be quicker than with open surgery.</p>\n<p>This operation involves making 3&nbsp;or 4&nbsp;small cuts (incisions) in your tummy (abdomen). Special instruments are then inserted, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a tube that gas is pumped through&nbsp;to inflate your abdomen &ndash; this allows the surgeon to see your appendix more clearly and gives them more room to work</li>\n<li>a laparoscope&nbsp;&ndash; a small tube containing a light source and a camera, which relays images of the inside of the abdomen to a television monitor</li>\n<li>small surgical tools used to remove the appendix</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once the appendix has been removed, the incisions will usually be closed with dissolvable&nbsp;stitches.&nbsp;Regular stitches&nbsp;may also be used, which need to be removed at your GP surgery 7 to 10 days later.</p>\n<h3>Open surgery</h3>\n<p>In some circumstances, keyhole surgery isn\'t recommended and open surgery is performed instead. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>when the appendix has already burst and formed a lump called an appendix mass</li>\n<li>when the surgeon isn\'t very experienced in laparoscopic removal</li>\n<li>people who have previously had open abdominal surgery</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In these cases, the operation involves making a single larger cut in the lower right-hand side of your abdomen to remove the appendix.</p>\n<p>When there\'s widespread peritonitis&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;infection of the inner lining of the abdomen&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;it\'s sometimes necessary to operate through a long cut along the middle of the abdomen in a procedure called a laparotomy.</p>\n<p>As with keyhole surgery, the incision&nbsp;is closed using either dissolvable stitches or regular stitches&nbsp;that need to be removed at a later date.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After both types of surgery, the removed appendix is routinely sent to a laboratory to check there are no signs of cancer. This is a precautionary measure, although it\'s rare for a serious problem to be found.</p>\n<h2>Recovery</h2>\n<p>One of the main advantages of keyhole surgery is the recovery time tends to be short and most people can leave hospital a few days after the operation.</p>\n<p>If the appendix is operated upon promptly, most patients can go home within 24 hours. With open or complicated surgery&nbsp;&ndash; for example, if you have peritonitis&nbsp;&ndash; it may&nbsp;take up to&nbsp;a week before you\'re well enough to go home.</p>\n<p>For the first few days after the operation you\'re likely to experience some pain and bruising. This improves over time, but you can take painkillers if necessary.</p>\n<p>If you had keyhole surgery, you may experience pain in the tip of your shoulder for about a week. This is caused by the gas that was pumped into the abdomen during the operation.</p>\n<p>You may also experience some short-term&nbsp;<a>constipation</a>. You can help reduce this by not taking codeine painkillers, eating plenty of fibre, and&nbsp;staying well hydrated. Your GP can prescribe medication if the problem is particularly troublesome.</p>\n<p>Before leaving hospital, you\'ll be advised about caring for your wound and what activities you should avoid.</p>\n<p>In most cases, you can return to normal activities in a couple of weeks, although more strenuous activities may need to be avoided for 4&nbsp;to 6&nbsp;weeks after open surgery.</p>\n<h3>When to seek medical advice</h3>\n<p>While you recover, it\'s important to keep an eye out for signs of any problems.</p>\n<p>Contact the hospital unit where the appendectomy was performed or your GP for advice if you notice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>increasing pain and swelling</li>\n<li>you start vomiting repeatedly</li>\n<li>a high temperature (fever)</li>\n<li>any discharge coming from the wound</li>\n<li>the wound is hot to touch</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These symptoms could be a sign of infection.</p>\n<h2>Risks</h2>\n<p>Appendectomies are one of the most commonly performed operations in the UK, and serious or long-term complications are rare.</p>\n<p>However, like all types of surgery, there are some risks. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>antibiotics may be given before, during, or after the operation to minimise the risk of serious infections</li>\n<li>bleeding under the skin that causes a firm swelling (haematoma) &ndash; this usually gets better on its own, but you should see your GP if you\'re concerned</li>\n<li>scarring &ndash; both surgical techniques will leave some scarring where the incisions were made</li>\n<li>a collection of pus (abscess) &ndash; in rare cases, an infection caused by the appendix bursting can lead to an abscess after surgery</li>\n<li>hernia &ndash; at the site of the open incision or any of the incisions used in the laparoscopic approach</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The use of general anaesthetic also carries some risks, such as the risk of an allergic reaction or inhaling stomach contents, leading to&nbsp;<a>pneumonia</a>. However, serious complications like this are very rare.</p>\n<h2>Alternatives to emergency surgery</h2>\n<p>In some cases, appendicitis can lead to the development of a lump on the appendix called an appendix mass.</p>\n<p>This lump, consisting of appendix and fatty tissue, is an attempt by the body to deal with the problem and heal itself.</p>\n<p>If an appendix mass is found during an examination, your doctors may decide it\'s not necessary to operate immediately.</p>\n<p>Instead, you\'ll be given a course of antibiotics and an appointment will be made for an appendectomy a few weeks later, when the mass has settled.</p>\n<p>Another possible alternative to immediate surgery is the use of antibiotics to treat appendicitis.</p>\n</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);
INSERT INTO `contents` VALUES (105,104,NULL,NULL,'<h2>About bowel polyps</h2>\n<p>Bowel polyps are small growths on the inner lining of the colon (large bowel) or rectum. They are common, affecting 15-20% of the UK population, and don\'t usually cause symptoms.</p>\n<p>Polyps are usually less than 1cm in size, although they can grow up to several centimetres. There are various forms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>some are a tiny raised area or bulge, known as&nbsp;a sessile polyp</li>\n<li>some&nbsp;look like a grape on a stalk, known as a pedunculated polyp</li>\n<li>some take the form of many tiny bumps clustered together</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bowel polyps&nbsp;are not usually cancerous, although&nbsp;if they\'re discovered they\'ll need to be removed, as some will eventually turn into cancer if left untreated.</p>\n<p>Some people just develop one polyp, while others may have a few.&nbsp;They tend to occur in people over the age of 60.</p>\n<h2>How are they caused?</h2>\n<p>Bowel polyps are caused by an abnormal production of cells. The lining of the bowel constantly renews itself, and a faulty gene can cause the cells in the bowel lining to grow more quickly.</p>\n<p>There may be a family tendency towards developing bowel polyps or bowel cancer.</p>\n<h2>What are the symptoms?</h2>\n<p>Most people with polyps won\'t be aware of them as they produce no symptoms and are often discovered by accident.</p>\n<p>However, some larger polyps can cause:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a small amount of rectal bleeding&nbsp;(blood in your stool)</li>\n<li>mucus to be produced when you open your bowels</li>\n<li><a>diarrhoea</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a >constipation</a></li>\n<li><a>abdominal pain</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How are they discovered?</h2>\n<p>Bowel polyps&nbsp;are usually found as a result of a bowel investigation for another reason, such as a sigmoidoscopy (examination of the last part of the bowel) or during&nbsp;<a>screening for bowel cancer</a>.</p>\n<p>If polyps are found, a colonoscopy or CT colonography&nbsp;is needed to view the whole of the large bowel and remove any polyps.</p>\n<h2>How are they treated?</h2>\n<p>There are several methods for treating polyps, but the most common procedure involves snaring the polyp&nbsp;during a colonoscopy. Snaring is like cutting the polyp off with cheese wire and is painless.</p>\n<p>Both of the above methods involve passing a flexible instrument called a colonoscope through your bottom and&nbsp;up into your bowel. The colonoscope has a wire with an electric current to either cauterise (burn off) or snare the polyp.</p>\n<p>In rare cases, polyps may need to be treated by surgically removing part of the bowel. This is usually only done when the polyp has some cell changes or is particularly large.</p>\n<p>After the polyp or polyps have been removed, they are sent to specialists in a laboratory, who will inform your consultant if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the polyp has been completely removed</li>\n<li>there is any risk of it regrowing</li>\n<li>there is any cancerous change in the polyp</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If there is a cancerous change in the polyp, you may need further treatment (depending on the degree and extent of change). Your specialist will be able to advise you on this.</p>\n<h2>Outlook</h2>\n<p>Some people will need further colonoscopies because polyps can recur. Polyps can sometimes run in families. This is uncommon, but&nbsp;means you\'ll need colonoscopy checks at regular intervals.</p>\n<p>You might be asked to have repeat examinations at intervals of around 3&nbsp;to 5&nbsp;years to catch any further polyps that may develop and potentially turn into bowel cancer.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(106,105,NULL,NULL,'<h2>Symptoms of cirrhosis</h2>\n<p>There are usually few symptoms during the early stages of cirrhosis. Noticeable problems tend to develop as the liver becomes more damaged.</p>\n<p>In&nbsp;early stage cirrhosis, the liver is able to function properly despite being damaged. As the condition progresses, symptoms tend to develop when functions of the liver are affected.</p>\n<p>Symptoms of cirrhosis&nbsp;can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>tiredness and weakness</li>\n<li>loss of appetite</li>\n<li>weight loss and muscle wasting</li>\n<li>feeling sick&nbsp;(nausea) and vomiting</li>\n<li>tenderness or pain around the liver area</li>\n<li>tiny red lines (blood capillaries) on the skin above waist level</li>\n<li>very itchy skin</li>\n<li>yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice)</li>\n<li>a tendency to bleed and bruise more easily, such as frequent&nbsp;<a>nosebleeds</a>&nbsp;or bleeding gums</li>\n<li>hair loss</li>\n<li>fever and shivering attacks</li>\n<li>swelling in the legs, ankles and feet due to a build-up of fluid (oedema)</li>\n<li>swelling in your abdomen (tummy), due to a build-up of fluid known as ascites (severe cases&nbsp;can make you look heavily pregnant)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may&nbsp;also notice changes in your personality, problems sleeping (<a>insomnia</a>), memory loss, confusion and difficulty concentrating. This is known as encephalopathy and&nbsp;occurs when toxins affect your brain because your liver is unable to remove them from your body.</p>\n<h2>Late-stage symptoms</h2>\n<p>In the later stages of cirrhosis, you may vomit blood or have tarry, black stools. This is because blood can\'t flow through the liver properly, which causes an increase in blood pressure in the vein that carries blood from the gut to the liver (portal vein).</p>\n<p>The increase in blood pressure forces blood through smaller, fragile vessels that line your stomach and gullet (varices). These can burst under high blood pressure, leading to internal bleeding, which is visible in vomit and/or stools.</p>\n<p>Over time, the toxins that would normally be removed from the body by a healthy liver can cause multiple organ failure, followed by death.</p>\n<h2>When to&nbsp;seek medical help</h2>\n<p>You should see your GP if you have persistent signs and symptoms of cirrhosis.</p>\n<p>Seek immediate medical help if you develop the following symptoms, particularly if you\'ve been previously diagnosed with cirrhosis:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>fever and shivering attacks</li>\n<li><a>shortness of breath</a>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>vomiting blood&nbsp;</li>\n<li>very dark or black tarry stools</li>\n<li>periods of mental confusion or drowsiness</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Causes of cirrhosis</h2>\n<p>There are many different causes of cirrhosis. In the UK, the most common causes are drinking excessive amounts of alcohol and long-term hepatitis C infections.</p>\n<p>In&nbsp;some cases, no specific cause is identified.</p>\n<h2>Alcohol consumption</h2>\n<p>The liver breaks down toxins (poisons), such as alcohol, but too much alcohol can scar and damage the liver\'s cells. Men and women who drink more than 14&nbsp;units of alcohol a week are considered to be drinking too much.</p>\n<p>If you\'re a heavy drinker, your chances of developing cirrhosis are increased. However, it\'s important to realise that cirrhosis of the liver isn\'t just a condition that affects people dependent on alcohol. If you\'re a heavy social drinker, you can also develop cirrhosis.</p>\n<p>Alcohol-related cirrhosis usually develops after 10 or more years of heavy drinking. For unknown reasons, some people are more susceptible to liver cell damage than others. Women who drink heavily are more susceptible to liver damage than men, partly because of their different body size and build.</p>\n<h3>Stages of alcoholic liver damage</h3>\n<p>People who drink excessively and continue to drink heavily develop cirrhosis in 3&nbsp;separate stages. These are described below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first stage of&nbsp;<a>alcohol-related liver disease</a>&nbsp;is known as \"fatty liver\", which almost all excessive drinkers develop. It\'s a side effect of the liver breaking alcohol down and disappears when you drink less.</li>\n<li>The second stage of alcohol-related liver disease is alcoholic hepatitis. Around 20-30% of people who continue to drink heavily develop alcoholic hepatitis. During this stage, the liver becomes inflamed. If alcoholic hepatitis deteriorates into its most extreme form (liver failure) it can lead to death.</li>\n<li>About 10% of heavy drinkers&nbsp;develop cirrhosis, which is the third stage of alcohol-related liver disease.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This risk of developing cirrhosis, along with the risk of alcoholic hepatitis, is one of the main reasons the government recommends that men and women should not regularly drink more than 14 units a week. If you do drink as much as 14 units a week, it is advised that you spread your drinking over three or more days.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A unit of alcohol is roughly equivalent to half a pint of normal-strength lager or a single measure (25ml) of spirits. A small glass of wine (125ml) is about 1.5 units.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;<a>alcohol units</a>.</p>\n<p>Your GP can give you help and advice if you\'re finding it difficult to cut down the amount you drink.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Hepatitis</h2>\n<p>Hepatitis&nbsp;is&nbsp;inflammation&nbsp;of the liver. Left untreated, it can damage the liver over many years, eventually resulting in cirrhosis.</p>\n<p>In&nbsp;the UK,&nbsp;<a>hepatitis C</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;the most common form of hepatitis. The hepatitis C&nbsp;virus&nbsp;is usually transmitted through blood-to-blood contact,&nbsp;most commonly by sharing needles used to inject drugs.</p>\n<p>Two other types of hepatitis infection,&nbsp;<a>hepatitis B</a>&nbsp;and D, can also cause cirrhosis.</p>\n<h2>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis</h2>\n<p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a severe liver condition that can lead to cirrhosis. As with alcohol-related liver disease, the early stage of NASH is the build-up of excess fat in the liver. This fat is associated with inflammation and scarring, which could lead to cirrhosis.</p>\n<p>NASH can develop in people&nbsp;who are&nbsp;obese, have&nbsp;<a>diabetes</a>, have&nbsp;high levels of fat in the blood (<a>high cholesterol</a>) and&nbsp;<a >high blood pressure</a>. Most people with NASH feel well and aren\'t aware&nbsp;they have a problem until cirrhosis occurs and liver function is affected.</p>\n<p>NASH is on the rise in the UK due to increasing levels of&nbsp;<a>obesity</a>&nbsp;and reduced physical activity. It\'s likely that it will overtake alcohol and hepatitis C as the most common cause of cirrhosis.</p>\n<h2>Other causes</h2>\n<p>There are a number of other conditions that can prevent the liver functioning healthily and can lead to cirrhosis. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>autoimmune&nbsp;liver disease &ndash; the immune system usually makes antibodies to attack bacteria and viruses; however, if you have an autoimmune disease, such as autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC),&nbsp;your immune system will make antibodies that attack healthy organs</li>\n<li>some rare, genetic conditions &ndash; such as haemochromatosis (a build-up of iron in the liver and other parts of the body) and Wilson\'s disease (a build-up of copper in the liver and other parts of the body)</li>\n<li>any condition that causes the bile ducts to become blocked &ndash; such as&nbsp;<a>cancer of the bile ducts</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>pancreatic cancer</a>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Budd-Chiari syndrome &ndash; caused by blood clots blocking the veins that carry blood from the liver</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Diagnosing cirrhosis</h2>\n<p>If your GP suspects cirrhosis, they\'ll check your medical history and carry out a physical examination to look for signs of chronic liver disease.</p>\n<p>If your GP suspects your liver is damaged, you\'ll be referred for tests to confirm the diagnosis.</p>\n<h2>Tests</h2>\n<p>You may have a number of different tests including those described below.</p>\n<h3>Blood tests</h3>\n<p><a>Blood tests</a>&nbsp;can measure your liver function and the amount of liver damage. A blood test may be used to measure the levels of the liver enzymes alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transferase (AST) in your blood, as these will be raised if you have inflammation of the liver (hepatitis).</p>\n<h3>Scans</h3>\n<p>An&nbsp;<a>ultrasound scan</a>,&nbsp;transient elastography scan,&nbsp;<a>computerised tomography (CT)</a>&nbsp;scan or a&nbsp;<a>magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</a>&nbsp;scan may be carried out on your liver. A&nbsp;transient elastography scan is similar to an ultrasound scan carried out during pregnancy (it\'s sometimes known as a Fibroscan).</p>\n<p>These scans can produce detailed images of your liver or check liver stiffness to identify any scarring.</p>\n<h3>Liver&nbsp;biopsy</h3>\n<p>A liver&nbsp;<a>biopsy</a>&nbsp;is where a&nbsp;fine needle is inserted into your body (usually between your ribs) to remove&nbsp;a small sample of liver cells. The sample is sent to a laboratory so it can be examined under a microscope.</p>\n<p>The biopsy is usually carried out under&nbsp;<a>local anaesthetic</a>, as a day case or with an overnight stay in hospital. The outcome of the biopsy will confirm a diagnosis of cirrhosis and may provide more information about the cause.&nbsp;However, transient elastography is increasingly being used as an alternative to a biopsy in the diagnosis of cirrhosis.</p>\n<h3>Endoscopy</h3>\n<p>An&nbsp;endoscopy is where an endoscope (a thin, long, flexible tube with a light and video camera at the end) is passed down your throat and into your stomach.</p>\n<p>Images of your oesophagus (tube from your throat to your stomach) and stomach are transmitted to an external screen where any varices (swollen vessels),&nbsp;which are a sign of cirrhosis, can be seen.</p>\n<h2>Grading</h2>\n<p>There are several different grading systems for cirrhosis according to how serious it is. One system is the&nbsp;Child-Pugh score which, based on your examination and laboratory tests, grades cirrhosis from A (relatively mild) to C (severe).</p>\n<p>An alternative&nbsp;system called&nbsp;model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) uses the results of a blood test to help identify&nbsp;people who need an urgent liver transplant.</p>\n<h2>Treating cirrhosis</h2>\n<p>Cirrhosis can\'t be cured, so treatment aims to manage the symptoms and any complications and stop the condition getting worse.</p>\n<p>It\'s usually not possible to reverse&nbsp;liver damage that\'s already occurred, although recent research suggests this may eventually be possible in cases where the underlying cause of the liver damage can be successfully treated.</p>\n<p>Treatment is likely to take place at a hospital with a specialist hepatology unit, which treats disorders of the liver, gall bladder and biliary ducts.</p>\n<h2>Stopping&nbsp;cirrhosis getting worse</h2>\n<p>Taking medication to treat&nbsp;the underlying cause of the liver damage&nbsp;and making healthy lifestyle changes can help stop cirrhosis getting worse and reduce your risk of developing further health problems.</p>\n<h3>Medication</h3>\n<p>The medication you need will depend on the specific cause of the damage to your liver.</p>\n<p>For example, if you have viral&nbsp;hepatitis you may be prescribed anti-viral medications. If you have autoimmune hepatitis you may be given steroid medication (<a>corticosteroids</a>) or medication to suppress your immune system (immunosuppressants).</p>\n<h3>Lifestyle changes</h3>\n<p>There are a number of things you can do to help yourself stay healthy and reduce your chances of developing further problems if you have cirrhosis, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>completely avoid&nbsp;<a>alcohol</a>, regardless of the cause of your cirrhosis, as&nbsp;alcohol consumption increases the rate at which the condition progresses</li>\n<li><a>lose weight</a>&nbsp;if you\'re overweight or obese</li>\n<li>regular&nbsp;<a>exercise</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;reduce muscle wasting</li>\n<li>practise&nbsp;good hygiene to reduce your chances of developing infections</li>\n<li>speak to your GP about&nbsp;<a >vaccinations</a>&nbsp;you may need, such as the&nbsp;<a>annual flu vaccine</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;travel vaccines</li>\n<li>speak to your GP or pharmacist if&nbsp;you\'re taking over-the-counter or prescription medications, as cirrhosis can affect the way your body processes some medicines</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a >Malnutrition</a>&nbsp;is common in people with cirrhosis, so it\'s important to ensure you have a&nbsp;<a>balanced diet</a>&nbsp;to help you get all the nutrients you need.</p>\n<p>Avoiding salty foods and&nbsp;not adding salt to foods you eat can help&nbsp;reduce your risk of developing swelling in your&nbsp;legs, feet and abdomen (tummy) caused by a build up of fluid. See&nbsp;tips for a lower salt diet for more information.</p>\n<p>The damage to your liver can also&nbsp;mean it\'s&nbsp;unable to store glycogen,&nbsp;a carbohydrate that provides short-term energy. When this happens, the body uses its own muscle tissue to provide energy between meals, which leads to muscle wasting and weakness. Therefore, you&nbsp;may need extra calories and protein in your diet.</p>\n<p>Healthy snacking between meals can top up your calories and protein.&nbsp;It may also be helpful to eat 3&nbsp;or 4&nbsp;small meals a day, rather than 1&nbsp;or 2&nbsp;large meals.</p>\n<h2>Easing symptoms</h2>\n<p>A number of treatments can ease the symptoms of cirrhosis, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a low-sodium (salt) diet or&nbsp;tablets called diuretics&nbsp;to reduce the amount of fluid in your body</li>\n<li>tablets to reduce high blood pressure in your portal vein (the main vein that transports blood from the gut to the liver) and prevent or treat any infection</li>\n<li>creams to reduce itching&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Managing complications of advanced cirrhosis</h2>\n<p>In cases of advanced cirrhosis, complications caused by the condition may&nbsp;need treatment.</p>\n<h3>Swollen varices</h3>\n<p>If you vomit blood or pass blood in your stools, you probably have swollen veins in your oesophagus (the long tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach). These are known as oesophageal varices.</p>\n<p>In these cases,&nbsp;urgent medical attention is required. This means seeing your GP or going to the&nbsp;accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department of your nearest hospital immediately.</p>\n<p>Certain procedures can help stop the bleeding and reduce the risk of it happening again, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Banding &ndash; an&nbsp;endoscopy is carried out (a thin, flexible tube is passed down your throat) and a small band is placed around the base of the varices to help control the bleeding.</li>\n<li>Injection glue therapy &ndash; following an endoscopy, a type of medical \"super glue\" is injected into the varices to make the blood clot, which helps to stop the bleeding.</li>\n<li>A Sengstaken tube with a balloon on the end &ndash; a special&nbsp;tube is passed down your throat into your stomach and the balloon is inflated. This&nbsp;puts pressure on the varices and helps stop the bleeding. You\'ll be heavily sedated during the procedure.</li>\n<li>A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPSS) &ndash; a metal tube called a stent is passed across your liver to join two large veins (the portal vein and hepatic vein). This creates a new route for your blood to flow through, therefore relieving the pressure that causes the varices.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may also be given a type of medication called a&nbsp;<a>beta-blocker</a>, such as propanolol, to reduce the risk of bleeding or reduce the severity of any bleed that&nbsp;does occur.</p>\n<h3>Fluid in the&nbsp;tummy and legs</h3>\n<p>Ascites (a build-up of fluid around your stomach area) and peripheral oedema (fluid around your legs and ankles) are common complications of advanced cirrhosis. They\'ll need to be addressed as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>You may have 20 to 30 litres of free water in your stomach area (abdomen), which can make it difficult for you to eat and breathe properly. The main treatments for ascites and oedema are restricting sodium (salt) in your diet and taking diuretic tablets, such as spironolactone or furosemide.</p>\n<p>If the&nbsp;fluid around your stomach becomes infected, you may need to be treated with&nbsp;<a>antibiotics</a>. Alternatively, antibiotics may be used on a regular basis&nbsp;to prevent infection in people at high risk.</p>\n<p>In severe cases of ascites, tubes may be used to drain the fluid from your abdomen. This will usually be repeated every few weeks.</p>\n<h3>Encephalopathy</h3>\n<p>People with cirrhosis can sometimes develop problems with their brain function (encephalopathy). This occurs because the liver isn\'t clearing toxins properly.</p>\n<p>The main treatment for encephalopathy is lactulose syrup. This acts as a&nbsp;<a>laxative</a>&nbsp;(it helps clear the bowels) and helps the body remove the toxins that build up in the body when the liver is failing. In some cases, other laxatives or an enema may be used.</p>\n<h3>Bleeding</h3>\n<p>Cirrhosis can affect the liver\'s ability to make the blood clot (thicken), leaving you at risk of severe bleeding if you cut yourself.&nbsp;<a>Vitamin K</a>&nbsp;and a blood product called plasma can be given in emergencies to treat episodes of bleeding.

However, when symptoms do occur, they may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>bleeding after passing a stool (the blood is usually bright red)</li>\n<li><a>itchy bottom</a></li>\n<li>a lump hanging down outside of the anus, which may need to be pushed back in after passing a stool</li>\n<li>a mucus discharge after passing a stool</li>\n<li>soreness, redness and swelling around your anus</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Haemorrhoids aren\'t usually painful, unless their blood supply slows down or is interrupted.</p>\n<h2>When to seek medical advice</h2>\n<p>See your GP if&nbsp;you have persistent or severe symptoms of haemorrhoids. You should always get any rectal bleeding checked out, so your doctor can rule out more potentially serious causes.</p>\n<p>The symptoms of haemorrhoids often clear up on their own or with simple treatments that can be bought from a pharmacy without a prescription&nbsp;(see below). However, speak to your GP if your symptoms don\'t get better or if you experience pain or bleeding.</p>\n<p>Your GP can often diagnose haemorrhoids using a simple internal examination of your back passage, although they may need to refer you to a colorectal specialist for diagnosis and treatment.</p>\n<p>Some people with haemorrhoids are reluctant to see their GP. However, there&rsquo;s no need to be embarrassed, because GPs are very used to diagnosing and treating haemorrhoids.</p>\n<h2>What causes&nbsp;haemorrhoids?</h2>\n<p>The exact cause of haemorrhoids is unclear, but&nbsp;they\'re associated with increased pressure in the&nbsp;blood vessels in and around your anus. This pressure can cause the blood vessels in your back passage to become swollen and inflamed.</p>\n<p>Many cases are thought to be caused by too much straining on the toilet, due to prolonged&nbsp;<a>constipation</a>&nbsp;&ndash; this is often due to a lack of&nbsp;fibre in a person\'s diet. Chronic (long-term)&nbsp;<a>diarrhoea</a>&nbsp;can also make you more vulnerable to getting haemorrhoids.</p>\n<p>Other factors that might increase your risk of developing haemorrhoids include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>being overweight or&nbsp;<a >obese</a></li>\n<li>age&nbsp;&ndash; as you get older, your body\'s supporting tissues get weaker, increasing your risk of haemorrhoids</li>\n<li>being&nbsp;pregnant&nbsp;&ndash; which can place increased pressure on your pelvic blood vessels, causing them to enlarge (read more about&nbsp;<a>common pregnancy problems</a>)</li>\n<li>having a family history of haemorrhoids</li>\n<li>regularly lifting heavy objects</li>\n<li>a&nbsp;persistent&nbsp;<a>cough</a>&nbsp;or repeated vomiting</li>\n<li>sitting down for long periods of time</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Preventing and treating haemorrhoids&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Haemorrhoid symptoms often&nbsp;settle down after&nbsp;a few days, without needing treatment. Haemorrhoids that occur during pregnancy often get better after giving birth.</p>\n<p>However, making lifestyle changes to reduce the strain on&nbsp;the blood vessels in and around your anus is often recommended. These can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>gradually&nbsp;increasing the amount of fibre in your diet &ndash; good sources of fibre include fruit, vegetables, wholegrain rice, wholewheat pasta and bread, pulses and beans, seeds, nuts and oats</li>\n<li>drinking plenty of fluid&nbsp;&ndash; particularly water,&nbsp;but avoiding or&nbsp;cutting down on caffeine and&nbsp;<a>alcohol</a></li>\n<li>not delaying going to the toilet &ndash; ignoring the urge to empty your bowels can make your stools harder and drier, which can lead to straining when you do go to the toilet</li>\n<li>avoiding medication that causes constipation &ndash; such as painkillers that contain codeine</li>\n<li><a>losing weight</a>&nbsp;(if you\'re overweight)</li>\n<li><a>exercising regularly</a>&nbsp;&ndash; can help prevent constipation, reduce your blood pressure and help you lose weight</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These measures can also reduce&nbsp;the risk of haemorrhoids returning, or even developing&nbsp;in the first place.</p>\n<p>Medication that you apply directly to your back passage (known as topical treatments) or tablets bought from a pharmacy or prescribed by your GP may ease your symptoms and make it easier for you to pass stools.</p>\n<p>There are various treatment options for more severe haemorrhoids. One of these options is banding, which is a non-surgical procedure where a very tight elastic band is put around the base of the haemorrhoid to cut off&nbsp;its blood supply. The haemorrhoid should fall off&nbsp;after about a week.</p>\n<p>Surgery carried out under&nbsp;<a>general anaesthetic</a>&nbsp;(where you\'re unconscious) is sometimes&nbsp;used to&nbsp;remove or shrink&nbsp;large or external haemorrhoids.</p>\n<h2>Diagnosing haemorrhoids</h2>\n<p>Your GP can diagnose haemorrhoids (piles) by examining your back passage to check for swollen blood vessels.</p>\n<p>Some people with haemorrhoids are reluctant to see their GP. However, there&rsquo;s no need to be embarrassed &ndash; all GPs are used to diagnosing and treating piles.</p>\n<p>It\'s important to tell your GP about all of your symptoms &ndash; for example, tell them if you\'ve recently lost a lot of weight, if your bowel movements have changed, or if your&nbsp;stools have become dark or sticky.</p>\n<h2>Rectal examination</h2>\n<p>Your GP may examine the outside of your anus to see if you have visible haemorrhoids, and they may also carry out an internal examination called a&nbsp;digital rectal examination (DRE).</p>\n<p>During a DRE, your GP will wear gloves and use lubricant. Using their finger, they\'ll&nbsp;feel for any abnormalities in your back passage. A DRE shouldn\'t be painful, but you may feel some slight discomfort.</p>\n<h2>Proctoscopy</h2>\n<p>In some cases, further internal examination using a proctoscope may be needed. A proctoscope is a thin hollow tube with a light on the end that\'s inserted into your anus.</p>\n<p>This allows&nbsp;your doctor to see your entire anal canal (the last section of the large intestine).</p>\n<p>GPs are sometimes able to carry out a proctoscopy. However, not all GPs have the correct training or access to the right equipment, so you may need to&nbsp;go to a&nbsp;hospital clinic&nbsp;to have the procedure.</p>\n<h2>Types of haemorrhoids</h2>\n<p>After you\'ve had a rectal examination or proctoscopy, your doctor will be able to&nbsp;determine what type of haemorrhoids you have.</p>\n<p>Haemorrhoids can develop internally or externally. Internal haemorrhoids develop in the upper two-thirds of your anal canal and external haemorrhoids in the lower third (closest to your anus). The nerves in the&nbsp;lower part can transmit pain messages, while the nerves&nbsp;in the upper part&nbsp;can\'t.</p>\n<p>Haemorrhoids can be further classified, depending on their size and severity. They can be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>first degree &ndash; small swellings that develop on the inside lining of the anus and aren\'t visible from outside the anus</li>\n<li>second degree &ndash; larger swellings that may come out of your anus when you go to the toilet, before disappearing inside again</li>\n<li>third degree &ndash; one or more small soft lumps that hang down from the anus and can be pushed back inside&nbsp;(prolapsing and reducible)</li>\n<li>fourth degree &ndash; larger lumps that hang down from the anus and can\'t be pushed back inside&nbsp;(irreducible)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It\'s useful for doctors to know what type&nbsp;and size of haemorrhoid you have, as they can then decide on the best treatment.</p>\n<h2>Treating haemorrhoids</h2>\n<div class=\"editor\">\n<p>Haemorrhoids (piles) often clear up by themselves after a few days. However, there are many treatments that can reduce itching and discomfort.</p>\n<p>Making simple dietary changes and not straining on the toilet are often recommended first.</p>\n<p>Creams, ointments and suppositories&nbsp;(which you&nbsp;insert into your bottom) are available from pharmacies without a prescription. They can be used to relieve any swelling and&nbsp;discomfort.</p>\n<p>If more intensive treatment is needed, the type will depend on where your haemorrhoids are in your anal canal &ndash; the lower third (closest to your anus)&nbsp;or the upper two-thirds. The lower third contain nerves which can transmit pain, while the upper two-thirds do not.</p>\n<p>Non-surgical treatments for haemorrhoids&nbsp;in the lower part of the canal&nbsp;are likely to be very painful, because the nerves in this area can detect pain. In these cases,&nbsp;<a>haemorrhoid surgery</a>&nbsp;will usually be recommended.</p>\n<p>The various treatments for&nbsp;haemorrhoids are outlined below.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Dietary changes and self care</h2>\n<p>If&nbsp;<a>constipation</a>&nbsp;is thought to be the cause of&nbsp;your haemorrhoids, you need to&nbsp;keep your stools soft and regular, so that you don\'t strain when passing stools.</p>\n<p>You can do this by increasing the amount of fibre in your diet. Good sources of fibre include wholegrain bread, cereal, fruit and vegetables.</p>\n<p>You should also&nbsp;drink plenty of water and avoid caffeine (found in tea, coffee and cola).</p>\n<p>When going to the toilet, you should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>avoid straining to pass stools, because it may make your haemorrhoids worse</li>\n<li>use&nbsp;moist toilet paper,&nbsp;rather than dry toilet paper, or baby wipes&nbsp;to clean your bottom&nbsp;after passing a stool</li>\n<li>pat the area&nbsp;around your bottom, rather than rubbing it</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Medication</h2>\n<h3>Over-the-counter topical treatments</h3>\n<p>Various creams, ointments and suppositories&nbsp;(which are inserted into your bottom) are available from pharmacies without a prescription. They can be used to relieve any swelling and&nbsp;discomfort.</p>\n<p>These medicines&nbsp;should only be used for five to seven days at a time. If you use them&nbsp;for longer, they may irritate the sensitive skin around your anus.&nbsp;Any medication should be combined with the diet and self-care advice discussed above.</p>\n<p>There\'s no evidence to suggest that one method is more effective than another. Ask your pharmacist for advice about which product is most suitable for you, and always read the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine before using it.</p>\n<p>Don\'t use more than one product at once.</p>\n<h3>Corticosteroid cream</h3>\n<p>If you have severe inflammation in and around your back passage, your GP&nbsp;may prescribe&nbsp;<a>corticosteroid cream</a>, which&nbsp;contains steroids.</p>\n<p>You shouldn\'t use corticosteroid cream for more than a week at a time, because it can make the skin around your anus thinner and the irritation worse.</p>\n<h3>Painkillers</h3>\n<p>Common painkilling medication, such as&nbsp;<a>paracetamol</a>, can help relieve the pain of haemorrhoids.</p>\n<p>However, if you have excessive bleeding, avoid using non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as&nbsp;<a>ibuprofen</a>, because it can make rectal bleeding worse. You should also avoid using codeine painkillers, because they can cause constipation.</p>\n<p>Your GP may prescribe products that contain&nbsp;<a>local anaesthetic</a>&nbsp;to treat painful haemorrhoids. Like over-the-counter topical treatments, these should only be used for a few days, because they can make the skin around&nbsp;your back passage more sensitive.</p>\n<h3>Laxatives</h3>\n<p>If you\'re constipated, your GP may prescribe a&nbsp;<a>laxative</a>. Laxatives are a type of medicine that can help you empty your bowels.</p>\n<h2>Non-surgical treatments</h2>\n<p>If dietary changes and medication don\'t improve your symptoms,&nbsp;your GP may refer you to a specialist. They can confirm whether you have haemorrhoids and recommend appropriate treatment.</p>\n<p>If you have haemorrhoids in the upper part of your anal canal, non-surgical procedures such as banding and sclerotherapy may be recommended.</p>\n<h3>Banding</h3>\n<p>Banding&nbsp;involves placing&nbsp;a very tight elastic band around the base of your haemorrhoids to cut off their&nbsp;blood supply. The haemorrhoids should then fall off&nbsp;within about a week of having the treatment.</p>\n<p>Banding is usually a day procedure that doesn\'t need an&nbsp;anaesthetic, and most people can get back to their normal activities the next day. You may feel some pain or discomfort for a day or so afterwards. Normal painkillers are usually adequate, but your GP can prescribe something stronger, if needed.</p>\n<p>You may not realise that your haemorrhoids have fallen off, as they should pass out of your body when you go to the toilet. If&nbsp;you notice some mucus discharge within a week of the procedure, it&nbsp;usually means that the haemorrhoids have fallen off.</p>\n<p>Directly after the procedure, you may notice blood on the toilet paper after going to the toilet.&nbsp;This is normal, but there shouldn\'t be a lot of bleeding. If you pass a lot of bright red blood or&nbsp;blood clots (solid lumps of blood), go to&nbsp;your nearest accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department immediately.</p>\n<p>Ulcers (open sores) can occur at the site of the banding, although these usually heal without needing further treatment.</p>\n<h3>Injections (sclerotherapy)</h3>\n<p>A treatment called sclerotherapy may be used as an alternative to banding.</p>\n<p>During sclerotherapy,&nbsp;a&nbsp;chemical solution is injected into the blood vessels in your back passage. This relieves pain by numbing the nerve endings at the site of the injection. It also hardens the tissue of the haemorrhoid so that a scar is formed. After about 4&nbsp;to 6&nbsp;weeks, the haemorrhoid should decrease in size or shrivel up.</p>\n<p>After the injection, you should avoid strenuous exercise for the rest of the day.&nbsp;You may experience minor pain for a while and may bleed a little. You should be able to resume normal activities, including work, the day after the procedure.</p>\n<h3>Electrotherapy</h3>\n<p>Electrotherapy, also known as electrocoagulation, is another&nbsp;alternative to banding&nbsp;for people with&nbsp;smaller&nbsp;haemorrhoids.</p>\n<p>During the procedure, a&nbsp;device called a proctoscope is inserted into the anus to locate&nbsp;the haemorrhoid.&nbsp;An electric current is then passed through a small metal probe that\'s placed at the base of the haemorrhoid, above the dentate line. The specialist&nbsp;can control the electric current using controls attached to the probe.</p>\n<p>The aim of electrotherapy&nbsp;is to cause the blood supplying the haemorrhoid to coagulate (thicken), which causes the haemorrhoid to shrink. If necessary, more than one haemorrhoid can be treated during each session.</p>\n<p>Electrotherapy&nbsp;can either be carried out on outpatient basis using a low electric current, or a higher dose can be given while the person is under a&nbsp;<a>general anaesthetic</a>&nbsp;or spinal anaesthetic.</p>\n<p>You may experience some mild pain during or after electrotherapy, but in most cases this doesn\'t last long.&nbsp;Rectal bleeding is another possible&nbsp;side effect of the procedure, but this is usually&nbsp;short-lived.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Electrotherapy&nbsp;is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), and has been shown to be an effective method of treating smaller haemorrhoids. It can also be used&nbsp;as an alternative to surgery for&nbsp;treating larger haemorrhoids, but there\'s less evidence of its effectiveness.</p>\n<h2>Surgery</h2>\n<p>Although most haemorrhoids can be treated using the methods described above, around 1 in every 10 people will eventually need surgery.</p>\n<p>Surgery is particularly useful for haemorrhoids that have developed below the dentate line because, unlike non-surgical treatments, anaesthetic is used to ensure you don&rsquo;t feel any pain.</p>\n<p>There are many different types of surgery that can be used to treat haemorrhoids, but they all usually involve either removing the haemorrhoids or reducing their blood supply, causing them to shrink.</p>\n</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(109,108,NULL,NULL,'<h2>Symptoms of indigestion</h2>\n<p>The main symptom of indigestion is pain or a feeling of discomfort in your upper abdomen (dyspepsia). People often experience the associated feeling of burning behind the breastbone (heartburn), but this may occur on its own.</p>\n<p>These symptoms&nbsp;usually come on soon after eating or drinking, although there can sometimes be a delay between eating a meal and experiencing indigestion.</p>\n<p><a>Heartburn</a>&nbsp;is caused by acid that passes from your stomach into your gullet (oesophagus).</p>\n<p>If you have indigestion, you may also have symptoms such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>feeling uncomfortably full or heavy</li>\n<li>belching or&nbsp;<a>flatulence</a>(passing wind)</li>\n<li>bringing&nbsp;food or fluid&nbsp;back up from your stomach (reflux)</li>\n<li>bloating</li>\n<li>feeling sick (nausea)</li>\n<li>vomiting</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Causes of indigestion</h2>\n<p>Indigestion has a number of different causes, but it\'s rarely due to a serious, underlying condition.</p>\n<p>It\'s normal for your stomach to produce acid, but sometimes this acid can irritate the lining of your stomach, the top part of your bowel (duodenum) or your gullet (oesophagus).</p>\n<p>This irritation can be painful and often causes a burning sensation. Indigestion may also be due to the lining of your digestive system being overly sensitive to acid, or the \"stretching\" caused by eating.</p>\n<p>Indigestion can also be triggered or made worse&nbsp;by other factors. Some of these are explained below.</p>\n<h2>Medications</h2>\n<p>You may have indigestion if you take certain types of medication. Some medicines, such as nitrates (taken to widen your blood vessels) relax the oesophageal sphincter (ring of muscle between your oesophagus and your stomach), which allows acid to leak back up.</p>\n<p>Other medicines, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (<a>NSAIDs</a>), can affect your digestive tract and cause&nbsp;indigestion.</p>\n<p>Do&nbsp;not take NSAIDs, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, if you have stomach problems, such as a&nbsp;<a>stomach ulcer</a>, or have had this in the past. Children under 16 years of age should not take aspirin.</p>\n<p>Never stop taking a prescribed medication unless you are&nbsp;told to do so by your GP or another qualified healthcare professional who is responsible for your care.</p>\n<h2>Obesity</h2>\n<p>If you are very overweight, you are more likely to experience indigestion because of increased pressure inside your stomach (abdomen).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The increased pressure, particularly after a large meal, may lead to acid reflux into the oesophagus.</p>\n<h2>Stress or anxiety</h2>\n<p>If you regularly experience feelings of stress or anxiety, this can contribute to symptoms of indigestion.</p>\n<p>Read&nbsp;some relaxation tips to relieve stress.</p>\n<h2>Hiatus hernia</h2>\n<p>A hernia occurs when an internal part of the body, such as an organ, pushes through a weakness in the surrounding muscle or tissue wall.</p>\n<p>A&nbsp;<a>hiatus hernia</a>&nbsp;occurs when part of your stomach pushes up into your diaphragm (the sheet of muscle under your lungs).&nbsp;It may partially block refluxed stomach&nbsp;acid clearing from your oesophagus, leading to heartburn.</p>\n<h2>Helicobacter pylori infection</h2>\n<p>Helicobacter infection is very common. It may lead to stomach ulcers or, rarely, stomach cancer. In most cases, however, it&nbsp;does not cause any symptoms at all.</p>\n<p>Some people may get bouts of indigestion from helicobacter infection and, in these cases, getting rid of the bug with antibiotics (eradication) will help. However, many cases of indigestion are not caused by helicobacter, and in these cases eradication will not get rid of symptoms.</p>\n<h2>Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)</h2>\n<p><a>Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)</a>&nbsp;is a common condition and one of the main causes of recurring indigestion. It\'s caused by acid reflux, which&nbsp;occurs when the oesophageal sphincter fails to prevent stomach acid from moving back up into your oesophagus.</p>\n<p>A little bit of acid reflux is normal and rarely cause any symptoms. It becomes GORD when large amounts of reflux occur, and the sensitive lining of your oesophagus may get inflamed by repeated irritation from stomach acid. This can lead to heartburn, the sensation of regurgitation or painful swallowing.</p>\n<h2>Stomach&nbsp;ulcers</h2>\n<p>A&nbsp;<a>stomach ulcer</a>&nbsp;is an open sore that develops on the inside lining of your stomach (a gastric ulcer) or small intestine (a duodenal ulcer). If you have a&nbsp;stomach ulcer, you may have indigestion as a symptom.</p>\n<p>Stomach&nbsp;ulcers form&nbsp;when stomach acid damages the lining in your stomach or duodenum wall. In most cases, the lining is damaged as a result of an H pylori infection (see above).</p>\n<h2>Stomach cancer</h2>\n<p>In rare cases, recurring bouts of indigestion can be a symptom of&nbsp;<a>stomach cancer</a>.</p>\n<p>Cancer cells in your stomach break down the protective lining, allowing acid to come into contact with your stomach wall.</p>\n<h2>Diagnosing indigestion</h2>\n<p>For most people, indigestion (dyspepsia) is mild and infrequent, and does not require treatment from a healthcare professional.</p>\n<p>However, if you have indigestion regularly, or if it causes you severe pain or discomfort, see your pharmacist.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They will ask about your indigestion symptoms, as well as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>any other symptoms you have &ndash; which&nbsp;may indicate an underlying health condition</li>\n<li>any medication you are taking &ndash; as some medications can cause indigestion</li>\n<li>your lifestyle &ndash; as some lifestyle factors, such as smoking, drinking alcohol or being overweight, can cause indigestion&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending on the type of indigestion symptoms you have, your pharmacist may recommend you see your GP to investigate your condition further. This is because indigestion can sometimes be a symptom of an underlying condition or health problem, such as a Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) bacterial infection.</p>\n<p>Details of some of the further investigations you may have are outlined below.</p>\n<h2>Further investigations</h2>\n<h3>Endoscopy</h3>\n<p>You may be referred to hospital to have an endoscopy.</p>\n<p>An endoscopy is a procedure used to examine the inside of your body using an endoscope &ndash; a thin, flexible tube, about the width of your little finger, with a light and a camera on one end. The camera is used to relay images of the inside of your body to a&nbsp;TV monitor.</p>\n<p>An endoscopy is not often needed to diagnose indigestion, but your GP may suggest that you have one if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>they need to examine the inside of your abdomen in more detail</li>\n<li>you have had treatment for indigestion that has not worked</li>\n<li>you have any&nbsp;<a>serious symptoms of indigestion</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read more&nbsp;about having an&nbsp;endoscopy.</p>\n<p>Taking certain medicines for indigestion can hide some of the problems that could otherwise be spotted during an endoscopy. Therefore, for at least two weeks before your endoscopy, you will need to stop taking proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2-receptor antagonists.</p>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;<a>treatments for indigestion</a>.</p>\n<p>Your GP may also recommend changing other medications that may be causing your indigestion. However, only stop taking medication if you are advised to do so by your GP or another healthcare professional responsible for your care.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Diagnosing H pylori infection</h3>\n<p>If your GP thinks that your symptoms may be due to an infection with H pylori bacteria, you may need to have a test for it, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a stool antigen test &ndash; a pea-sized stool (faeces) sample will be tested for H pylori bacteria</li>\n<li>a breath test</li>\n<li>a&nbsp;<a>blood test</a>&ndash; a blood sample will be tested for antibodies to H pylori bacteria (antibodies are proteins produced by the body to fight infection)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a>Antibiotics</a>&nbsp;and PPIs can affect the results of a urea breath test or a stool antigen test. Therefore, these tests may need to be delayed until two weeks after you last used a PPI, and four weeks after you last used an antibiotic.</p>\n<h3>Diagnosing other conditions</h3>\n<p>If your GP thinks that your indigestion symptoms may be caused by another underlying medical condition, you may need to have some further tests to rule this out.</p>\n<p>For example, abdominal pain and discomfort can also be caused by conditions affecting the bile ducts in your liver. Your bile ducts are a series of tubes that carry bile (fluid used by the digestive system to break down fats) from the liver to the gallbladder (a pouch that holds bile) and the bowel. If your GP thinks that you may have such a condition, they may suggest you have a liver function test, which is a type of blood test used to assess how well your liver is working.</p>\n<p>You may also need to have an abdominal ultrasound. An&nbsp;<a>ultrasound scan</a>&nbsp;uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your body.</p>\n<h2>Treating indigestion</h2>\n<p>Treatment for indigestion (dyspepsia) will vary, depending on what is causing it and how severe your symptoms are.</p>\n<p>If you have been diagnosed with an underlying health condition, you may want to read our information on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a>treating gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)</a></li>\n<li><a>treating a&nbsp;stomach ulcer</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Diet and lifestyle changes</h2>\n<p>If you only have indigestion occasionally, you may not need to see your pharmacist or GP for treatment. It may be possible to ease your symptoms by making a few simple changes to your diet and lifestyle, summarised below.</p>\n<h3>Healthy weight</h3>\n<p>Being overweight puts more pressure on your stomach, making it easier for stomach acid to be pushed back up into your gullet (oesophagus). This is known as acid reflux, and is one of the most common causes of indigestion.</p>\n<p>If you are overweight or obese, it is important to lose weight safely and steadily through regular exercise and by eating a healthy, balanced diet. Read advice on&nbsp;<a>losing weight</a>.</p>\n<h3>Stop smoking</h3>\n<p>If you smoke, the chemicals you inhale in cigarette smoke may contribute to your indigestion. These chemicals can cause the ring of muscle that separates your oesophagus from your stomach to relax, causing acid reflux.</p>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;<a>quitting smoking</a>, or speak to your GP or pharmacist. You can also call the&nbsp;<a>Quit Your Way Scotland</a>&nbsp;service on 0800 84 84 84 (8.00am to 10.00pm, every day).</p>\n<h3>Diet and alcohol</h3>\n<p>Make a note of any particular food or drink that seems to make your indigestion worse, and avoid these if possible. This may mean:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>eating less rich, spicy and fatty foods</li>\n<li>cutting down on drinks that contain caffeine &ndash; such as tea, coffee and cola</li>\n<li>avoiding or cutting down on alcohol</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>At bedtime</h3>\n<p>If you tend to experience indigestion symptoms at night, avoid eating for three to four hours before you go to bed. Going to bed with a full stomach means there is an increased risk that acid in your stomach will be forced up into your oesophagus while you are lying down.</p>\n<p>When you go to bed, use a couple of pillows to prop your head and shoulders up or, ideally,&nbsp;raise the head of your bed by a few inches by putting something underneath the mattress. The slight slope that is created should help to prevent stomach acid moving up into your oesophagus while you are asleep.</p>\n<h3>Stress or anxiety</h3>\n<p>If you regularly experience feelings of stress or anxiety, this can contribute to symptoms of indigestion.</p>\n<p>Read some&nbsp;<a>relaxation tips to relieve stress</a>.</p>\n<h2>Changing current medication</h2>\n<p>Your pharmacist may recommend making changes to your current medication if they think it could be contributing to your indigestion.</p>\n<p>As long as it is safe to do so, you may need to stop taking certain medications, such as aspirin or ibuprofen. Where required, your pharmacist may advise you see your GP to prescribe an alternative medication that will not cause indigestion. However, never stop taking any medication without consulting your pharmacist or GP first.</p>\n<h2>Immediate indigestion relief</h2>\n<p>If you have indigestion that requires immediate relief, your pharmacist can advise you about the best way to treat this. As well as lifestyle changes and reviewing your current medication, your GP may prescribe or recommend:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>antacid medicines</li>\n<li>alginates</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are described in more detail below.</p>\n<h3>Antacids</h3>\n<p>Antacids are a type of medicine that can provide immediate relief for mild to moderate symptoms of indigestion. They work by neutralising the acid in your stomach (making it less acidic), so that it no longer irritates the lining of your digestive system.</p>\n<p>Antacids are available in tablet and liquid form. You can buy them over the counter from most pharmacies without a prescription.</p>\n<p>The effect of an antacid only lasts for a few hours at a time, so you may need to take more than one dose. Always follow the instructions on the packet to ensure you do not take too much.</p>\n<p>It is best to take antacids when you are expecting symptoms of indigestion, or when they start to occur, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>after meals</li>\n<li>at bedtime</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is because antacids stay in your stomach for longer at these times and have more time to work. For example, if you take an antacid at the same time as eating a meal, it can work for up to three hours. In comparison, if you take an antacid on an empty stomach, it may only work for 20 to 60 minutes.</p>\n<p>Read more&nbsp;about&nbsp;antacids, including possible interactions with other medicines and side effects.</p>\n<h3>Alginates</h3>\n<p>Some antacids also contain a medicine&nbsp;called an alginate. This helps relieve indigestion caused by acid reflux.</p>\n<p>Acid reflux occurs when stomach acid leaks back up into your oesophagus and irritates its lining. Alginates&nbsp;form a foam barrier that floats on the surface of your stomach contents, keeping stomach acid in your stomach and away from your oesophagus.</p>\n<p>Your pharmacist may suggest that you take an antacid that contains an alginate if you experience symptoms of acid reflux or if you have GORD.</p>\n<p>Take antacids containing alginates after eating, because this helps the medicine stay in your stomach for longer. If you take alginates on an empty stomach, they will leave your stomach too quickly to be effective.</p>\n<h2>Treating persistent indigestion</h2>\n<p>If you have indigestion that is persistent or recurring, treatment with antacids and alginates may not be effective enough to control your symptoms. Your pharmacist may recommend a different type of medication, which will&nbsp;be prescribed at the lowest possible dose to control your symptoms. Possible medications include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)</li>\n<li>H2-receptor antagonists</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are described in more detail below. Your pharmacist may advise you to see your GP who may also test you for the Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) bacteria (see&nbsp;<a>Indigestion &ndash; diagnosis</a>) and prescribe treatment for this if necessary.</p>\n<h3>Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)</h3>\n<p>PPIs restrict the acid produced in your stomach.</p>\n<p>The medication is&nbsp;taken as tablets and if you are over 18, you can buy some types of PPIs over the counter in pharmacies, but these should only be used for short-term treatment. PPIs may enhance the effect of certain medicines. If you are prescribed a PPI, your progress will be monitored if you are also taking other medicines, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>warfarin &ndash; a medicine that stops the blood clotting</li>\n<li>phenytoin &ndash; a medicine to treat epilepsy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If your ingestion is persistent, your pharmacist might advise you to see your GP.</p>\n<p>If your GP refers you for an endoscopy (a procedure that allows a surgeon to see inside your abdomen), you will need to stop taking a PPI at least 14 days before the procedure. This is because PPIs can hide some of the problems that would otherwise be spotted during the endoscopy.</p>\n<p>PPIs can sometimes cause side effects. However, they are usually mild and reversible. These side effects may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>headaches</li>\n<li>diarrhoea</li>\n<li>constipation</li>\n<li>feeling sick (nausea)</li>\n<li>vomiting</li>\n<li>flatulence</li>\n<li>stomach pain</li>\n<li>dizziness</li>\n<li>skin rashes</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>H2-receptor antagonists</h3>\n<p>H2-receptor antagonists are another type of medication that your pharmacist or GP may suggest if antacids, alginates and PPIs have not been effective in controlling your indigestion. There are four H2-receptor antagonists:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>cimetidine&nbsp;</li>\n<li>famotidine&nbsp;</li>\n<li>nizatidine&nbsp;</li>\n<li>ranitidine&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These medicines work by lowering the acidity level in your stomach.</p>\n<p>Your GP may prescribe any one of these four H2-receptor antagonists, although ranitidine is available from pharmacies under the Pharmacy First Scotland service. H2-receptor antagonists are usually taken in tablet form.</p>\n<p>As with PPIs, you will need to stop taking H2-receptor antagonists at least 14 days before having an endoscopy if this has been arranged through your GP. This is&nbsp;because they can hide some of the problems that could otherwise be spotted during the endoscopy.</p>\n<h3>Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection</h3>\n<p>If your indigestion symptoms are caused by an infection with H pylori bacteria, you will need to have treatment to clear the infection from your stomach. This should help relieve your indigestion, because the H pylori bacteria will no longer be increasing the amount of acid in your stomach.</p>\n<p>H pylori infection is usually treated using triple therapy (treatment with three different medications). Your GP will prescribe a course of treatment containing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>two different antibiotics (medicines to treat infections that are caused by bacteria)</li>\n<li>a PPI</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You will need to take these medicines twice a day for seven days. You must follow the dosage instructions closely to ensure that the triple therapy is effective.</p>\n<p>In up to 85% of cases, one course of triple therapy is effective in clearing an H pylori infection. However, you may need to have more than one course of treatment if it does not clear the infection the first time.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(110,109,NULL,NULL,'<h2>About liver disease</h2>\n<p>There are more than 100 different types of liver disease, which together affect at least 2 million people in the UK.</p>\n<h2>The liver</h2>\n<p>The liver is the second largest organ in the body.

Sometimes, the symptoms of asthma only occur when you have hay fever. These symptoms include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>tight chest</li>\n<li><a>shortness of breath</a></li>\n<li>coughing</li>\n<li>wheezing</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Pollen count</strong></h2>\n<p>Hay fever symptoms are likely to be worse if the pollen count is high. The pollen count is the number of grains of pollen in one cubic metre of air.</p>\n<p>Air samples are collected in traps set on buildings 2&nbsp;or 3&nbsp;storeys high. Taking samples from this height gives a better indication of the pollen in the air. Traps on the ground would only collect pollen from nearby trees and plants.</p>\n<p>The air is sucked into the trap and the grains of pollen are collected on either sticky tape or microscope slides (glass plates). The pollen is then counted. Samples are normally taken every 2&nbsp;hours, and usually the results are averaged&nbsp;over a 24-hour period.</p>\n<p>The pollen forecast is usually given as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>low &ndash; less than 30 grains of pollen in every cubic metre of air</li>\n<li>moderate &ndash; 30 to 49 grains of pollen in every cubic metre of air</li>\n<li>high &ndash;&nbsp;50 to 149 grains of pollen in every cubic metre of air</li>\n<li>very high &ndash; 150 or more grains of pollen in every cubic metre of air</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hay fever symptoms often begin when the pollen count is over 50. The pollen count is usually given as part of the weather forecast during the spring and summer months.</p>\n<h2>Causes of hay fever</h2>\n<p>Hay fever is an allergic reaction to pollen. When these tiny particles come into contact with the cells that line your mouth, nose, eyes and throat, they irritate them and trigger an allergic reaction.</p>\n<h2><strong>Allergic reaction</strong></h2>\n<p>When you have an allergic reaction, your body overreacts to something it perceives as a threat. In hay fever, the allergen (the substance you\'re allergic to) is pollen. Your immune system (the body&rsquo;s natural defence) responds as if it were being attacked by a virus.</p>\n<p>Your immune system will release a number of chemicals designed to prevent the spread of what it wrongly perceives as an infection. These chemicals cause the symptoms of the allergic reaction, such as watering eyes and a runny nose.</p>\n<h2><strong>Risk factors</strong></h2>\n<p>It\'s unclear what causes the immune system to react in this way, but there are several factors that can increase your risk of developing hay fever. They include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>having&nbsp;<a>asthma</a>or another allergic condition, such as&nbsp;<a>eczema</a></li>\n<li>having a family history of hay fever</li>\n<li>being exposed to tobacco smoke and diesel exhaust particles during early childhood</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most people with hay fever are allergic to grass pollen, but it can also be caused by trees and weeds. Research suggests that pollution, such as cigarette smoke or car exhaust fumes, can make&nbsp;<a>allergies</a>&nbsp;worse.</p>\n<h2><strong>Pollen</strong></h2>\n<p>There are around 30 types of pollen that could cause your hay fever. The pollen that causes hay fever can come from a number of sources, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>grass &ndash;&nbsp;in the UK, about 9 out of 10 (90%) of people with hay fever are allergic to Timothy and Rye grass pollen</li>\n<li>trees &ndash;&nbsp;about 1 in 4 (25%) of people&nbsp;with hay fever&nbsp;in the UK are allergic to pollen from trees, including oak, ash, cedar and birch (people with an allergy to birch often also experience an allergic reaction to apples, peaches, plums and cherries because&nbsp;these types of fruit contain a similar protein to birch pollen)</li>\n<li>weeds &ndash;&nbsp;such as&nbsp;dock, mugwort and nettles;&nbsp;being allergic to weeds is less common and tends to occur during the autumn&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It\'s possible to be allergic to more than one type of pollen.</p>\n<h3><strong>When is there most pollen?</strong></h3>\n<p>Different trees and plants produce their pollen at different times of the year. Depending on which type of pollen you\'re allergic to, you may experience hay fever symptoms at different times.</p>\n<p>In the UK, the pollen count&nbsp;season is usually separated into 3&nbsp;periods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>tree pollen &ndash; late March to mid-May</li>\n<li>grass pollen &ndash; mid-May to July</li>\n<li>weed pollen &ndash; end of June to September</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, the pollen count season can sometimes begin as early as January or end in November. For example, depending on the weather conditions, sometimes there can be an \"early spring\" or a&nbsp;\"long summer\".</p>\n<h3><strong>The effect of the weather</strong></h3>\n<p>The amount of sunshine, rain or wind affects how much pollen plants release and how much it\'s spread around. On humid and windy days, pollen spreads easily. On rainy days, pollen may be cleared from the air, causing pollen levels to fall.</p>\n<p>During their pollen season, plants release pollen early in the morning. As the day gets warmer and more flowers open, pollen levels rise. On sunny days, the&nbsp;pollen count is highest in the early evening.</p>\n<h2>Diagnosing hay fever</h2>\n<p>Your pharmacist should be able to diagnose hay fever from a description of your symptoms. In some cases, you may be advised to speak to your GP as you may need allergy testing.</p>\n<p>A diagnosis for hay fever would usually only be required:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>if your symptoms were particularly severe</li>\n<li>the pattern of your symptoms was unusual&nbsp;&ndash; for example, if you have&nbsp;symptoms during the winter or while indoors</li>\n<li>if you had experienced&nbsp;<a>complications of hay fever</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If possible, keep a diary of the times of day or year you experience your symptoms, as this can help with the diagnosis.</p>\n<h2><strong>Allergy&nbsp;testing</strong></h2>\n<p>Your GP may refer you to an immunologist for an allergy test if you have&nbsp;<a>hay fever symptoms</a>&nbsp;all year round (called persistent&nbsp;<a>allergic rhinitis</a>), or symptoms that aren\'t responding to treatment. Other substances could be causing your allergy, such as house dust mites, animals or certain foods.</p>\n<p>The 2&nbsp;main allergy tests are a skin prick test and a&nbsp;<a>blood test</a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>Skin prick test</strong></h3>\n<p>During a skin prick test, an&nbsp;immunologist&nbsp;will place the pollen allergen on your arm and prick the surface of your skin with a needle. This will introduce the allergen to your skin\'s immune system (mast cells)&nbsp;and, if you\'re allergic to it, you should have a reaction on the skin.</p>\n<p>If your skin starts to go red around where it was pricked, swells up or becomes itchy, this could be an allergic reaction and would confirm that you have hay fever.</p>\n<p>A skin prick test may not be suitable if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you\'re on certain medications, such as&nbsp;antihistamines, which will stop you having an allergic reaction</li>\n<li>you have significant&nbsp;<a >eczema</a>, as your skin may already be red or itchy, so an allergic reaction won\'t be noticeable</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this case, a blood test may be necessary to confirm your diagnosis (see below).</p>\n<p>The use of commercial home allergy testing kits isn\'t recommended. The testing is often of a lower standard than that provided by the NHS or accredited private clinics. It\'s also important that the test results are interpreted by a qualified professional who has detailed knowledge of your symptoms and medical history.</p>\n<h3><strong>Blood test</strong></h3>\n<p>A sample of blood will be taken from a vein in your arm and tested for the presence of the Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody.</p>\n<p>If you have hay fever, your body produces this antibody when it comes into contact with pollen. If your blood tests positive for IgE, this may confirm that you have hay fever.</p>\n<h2>Treating hay fever</h2>\n<p>The various treatments for hay fever are outlined below.</p>\n<h2><strong>Antihistamines</strong></h2>\n<p>Antihistamines treat hay fever by blocking the action of the chemical histamine, which the body releases when it thinks it\'s under attack from an allergen. This stops the symptoms of the allergic reaction.</p>\n<p>Antihistamines are usually effective at treating itching, sneezing and watery eyes, but they may not help&nbsp;with clearing a blocked nose.</p>\n<p>They\'re available in tablet form and also as nasal sprays and eye drops.</p>\n<p>You can use antihistamines as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>an \"as-required\" treatment &ndash; you take them when you first notice you\'re developing the symptoms of hay fever</li>\n<li>a preventative treatment &ndash; for example, if you know there\'s going to be a high pollen count, you can take them before leaving the house in the morning</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Different antihistamine tablets for hay fever include cetirizine, fexofenadine and loratadine. Azelastine is an effective antihistamine nasal&nbsp;spray and olopatadine is an antihistamine eye drop.</p>\n<p>Unlike older antihistamines, these newer types shouldn\'t cause drowsiness, although this can occasionally happen to some people.</p>\n<p>If you do become drowsy after using&nbsp;antihistamines, you should avoid driving or using heavy tools or machinery. You should also contact your GP or pharmacist, as there may be an alternative antihistamine you can take.</p>\n<h2><strong>Corticosteroid nasal sprays and drops</strong></h2>\n<p>Corticosteroids (steroids) are used to treat hay fever because they have an anti-inflammatory effect.</p>\n<p>When pollen triggers your allergic reaction, the inside of your nose becomes inflamed. Corticosteroids can reduce the inflammation and prevent the symptoms of hay fever.</p>\n<p>Your GP may prescribe corticosteroid nasal sprays or drops instead of antihistamines if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you have persistent hay fever that doesn\'t respond to antihistamines</li>\n<li>your main symptom is a blocked nose</li>\n<li>you\'re pregnant or breastfeeding</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Corticosteroid nose drops (containing betamethasone and fluticasone) are more powerful than corticosteroid nose sprays and shouldn\'t be used for prolonged periods of more than 2&nbsp;to 4&nbsp;weeks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Corticosteroids are better than antihistamine tablets at preventing and relieving nasal symptoms, including sneezing and congestion. They can also relieve itchy, watery eyes. They\'re most effective if you start using them a couple of weeks before your symptoms begin, and work best when used regularly.</p>\n<p>It\'s important that you read the instructions that come with your medication, as applying the drops or the spray incorrectly can increase your risk of developing side effects, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>irritation and dryness of your nose</li>\n<li>bleeding from your nose</li>\n<li>unpleasant taste in your mouth</li>\n<li>itchy skin rash around your nose</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Corticosteroid tablets</strong></h2>\n<p>If you require rapid short-term relief from severe symptoms&nbsp;&ndash; for example, if you have an exam or driving test coming up&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;your GP may prescribe a course of corticosteroid tablets for 5&nbsp;to 7&nbsp;days.</p>\n<p>The use of corticosteroids for longer than 10 days isn\'t recommended, because&nbsp;the longer you take steroid tablets the more likely it is you\'ll begin to experience unpleasant side effects, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>weight gain</li>\n<li>changes in mood, such as feeling irritable</li>\n<li><a>acne</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Nasal decongestants</strong></h2>\n<p>Hay fever can cause a blocked nose. A decongestant, in the form of a nasal spray, can relieve this. Decongestants reduce the swelling of the blood vessels in your nose, which opens your nasal passage and makes breathing easier.</p>\n<p>Your pharmacist can recommend a suitable nasal decongestant. Check the ingredients, as some decongestants also contain antihistamine. If they do, they may relieve other symptoms as well. If not, the decongestant will only relieve your blocked nose.</p>\n<p>Nasal decongestants shouldn\'t be used for longer than 7&nbsp;days. They may cause dryness and irritation in your nasal passage, and can make the symptoms of congestion worse (this is known as rebound congestion or rhinitis medicamentosa).</p>\n<h2><strong>Eye drops</strong></h2>\n<p>Eye drops are available from your pharmacist to treat the hay fever symptoms that affect your eyes, such as redness, itchiness and watering (<a href=\"https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/eyes/conjunctivitis\">allergic conjunctivitis</a>). The&nbsp;drops contain antihistamine, such as azelastine and olopatadine,&nbsp;to reduce the inflammation in your eyes, which will relieve the symptoms.</p>\n<p>Eye drops containing the active ingredient sodium cromoglicate (a mast cell stabiliser) are the most widely used and have been shown to be extremely safe. Check the patient information leaflet for the correct way to use them. Some may cause side effects, such as a stinging or burning sensation in your eyes.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Immunotherapy</strong></h2>\n<p>If you have persistent hay fever symptoms that aren\'t relieved by the above treatments, your GP may refer you for immunotherapy treatment. This involves gradually introducing you to small amounts of the allergen (the substance you\'re allergic to), such as pollen, and monitoring your allergic reaction in a controlled environment.</p>\n<p>Immunotherapy is only carried out in specialist medical centres, in case a serious allergic reaction, known as&nbsp;<a>anaphylaxis</a>, occurs.</p>\n<p>The allergen can be given to you as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>an injection into your skin &ndash; this is known as systemic injection immunotherapy (SIT)</li>\n<li>a tablet that dissolves under your tongue &ndash; this is known as sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After the initial treatment, you\'ll be monitored for up to an hour.</p>\n<p>Further doses of&nbsp;SLIT&nbsp;can safely be administered at home after an initial dose has been given under medical supervision.</p>\n<p>To work in the first year, treatment should be started 3&nbsp;months before the pollen season. As you get used to the allergen, the amount used will slowly be increased. You\'ll gradually start to build up immunity to the allergen, and your allergic reaction to it should get less severe. 3&nbsp;years of treatment is recommended to achieve long-term pollen desensitisation.</p>\n<p>Immunotherapy&nbsp;can improve your tolerance of the allergen, which can improve your quality of life and have long-term results. However, if you don\'t see a significant improvement in your symptoms during the first year, then the treatment is unlikely to help and shouldn\'t be continued.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(114,113,NULL,NULL,'<h2>Symptoms of HIV</h2>\n<p>People who are infected with HIV, often experience a short flu like illness that occurs 2 to 6 weeks after infection.

If signs of infection are found, the result is \"positive\".</p>\n<p>The full blood test is the most accurate test and can normally give reliable results from four weeks after infection. The other tests whilst also accurate, may not give a reliable result for a longer period after exposure to the infection (this is known as the \"window period\").</p>\n<p>For all these tests, a full blood test should be carried out to confirm the result if the first test is positive.

These medicines come in the form of tablets which need to be taken every day.<br /><br />HIV can develop resistance to a single HIV drug very easily, but by taking a combination of different drugs or with support from your doctor in taking your treatment, resistance is less likely. Most people with HIV take a combination of three antiretrovirals (although some people take 1 or 2) and it\'s vital that the medications are taken every day as recommended by your doctor.<br /><br />For people living with HIV, taking effective antiretroviral therapy (where the HIV virus is \"undetectable\" in blood tests) will prevent you passing on HIV to sexual partners.</p>\n<p>Read more about treating HIV:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Terrence Higgins Trust:&nbsp;<a>Treatment for HIV</a></li>\n<li>HIV i-Base:&nbsp;<a>Introduction to combination therapy</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Missing a dose</h2>\n<p>HIV treatment works best if you take your pills regularly every day.

A rash over the cheeks and the bridge of the nose is particularly common and is known as a \"butterfly rash\" or \"malar rash\".</p>\n<p>Rashes caused by SLE may&nbsp;get better&nbsp;after a few days or weeks, but can last longer or even be permanent.</p>\n<p>Rashes caused by SLE can sometimes be itchy or painful, and they may get worse if they are exposed to sunlight. This is known as \"photosensitivity\".</p>\n<h2>Other symptoms</h2>\n<p>SLE can also cause a wide range of symptoms.&nbsp;However, you\'re unlikely&nbsp;to have all of the symptoms listed below, and many people with the condition will only experience&nbsp;the main symptoms.</p>\n<p>Other&nbsp;features of SLE may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a fever (high temperature)</li>\n<li><a>swollen lymph glands</a>&nbsp;(small glands found throughout your body, including in your neck, armpits and groin)</li>\n<li>recurring&nbsp;<a>mouth ulcers</a></li>\n<li>hair loss&nbsp;(alopecia)</li>\n<li><a>high blood pressure</a>&nbsp;(hypertension)</li>\n<li><a>headaches</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a >migraines</a></li>\n<li><a >stomach (abdominal) pain</a></li>\n<li>chest pain</li>\n<li><a>depression</a>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>dry eyes</li>\n<li>memory loss</li>\n<li>seizures (fits)</li>\n<li>problems thinking clearly and difficulty telling the difference between reality and imagination (<a>psychosis</a>)</li>\n<li><a>shortness of breath</a></li>\n<li><a>Raynaud\'s phenomenon</a>&nbsp;&ndash; a condition that limits the blood supply to your hands and feet&nbsp;when it is cold</li>\n<li>ankle swelling and fluid retention (oedema)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>When to seek medical advice</h2>\n<p>You should see your GP if you have persistent or troublesome symptoms that you think could be caused by SLE.</p>\n<p>While it is likely that your symptoms are being caused by a more common condition, it is important to see a doctor for a diagnosis.</p>\n<h2>Causes of lupus</h2>\n<p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune condition, which means it is caused by problems with the immune system.</p>\n<p>The immune system is the body&rsquo;s natural defence against illness and infection. When the immune system detects the presence of an infectious agent, such as bacteria or a virus, it sends white blood cells and antibodies to attack it.</p>\n<p>In cases of SLE, antibodies released by the immune system can attack healthy tissue, cells and organs.</p>\n<p>It\'s not clear exactly why this happens, although most experts think SLE has more than one cause. It has been suggested that there may be a number of genetic factors that make people more susceptible to the condition, and that it also takes one or more environmental factors to trigger SLE in those who are susceptible.</p>\n<p>Possible genetic and environmental factors are discussed in more detail below.</p>\n<h2>Genetic factors</h2>\n<p>Brothers and sisters of people with SLE are much more likely to develop the condition than the population at large.</p>\n<p>Researchers have identified a number of different genetic mutations that seem to make people more susceptible to developing SLE. A genetic mutation occurs when normal instructions carried in certain genes become \"scrambled\", resulting in the body&rsquo;s processes not working normally.</p>\n<p>Most faulty genes are associated with regulating certain functions of the immune system, which may explain why the immune system in people with SLE starts to malfunction.</p>\n<h2>Environmental factors</h2>\n<p>A number of environmental factors may be responsible for triggering SLE in vulnerable individuals, although the evidence for many of these is limited.</p>\n<p>Possible environmental factors that have been suggested include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>exposure to sunlight (ultraviolet light)</li>\n<li>hormonal changes that occur during a woman&rsquo;s lifetime, such as during&nbsp;puberty or pregnancy</li>\n<li>certain infections, such as by the&nbsp;Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) &ndash; a common viral infection that doesn\'t usually cause any symptoms</li>\n<li>smoking</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Diagnosing lupus</h2>\n<p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can be difficult to diagnose, as it has similar symptoms to several other, far more common, conditions.</p>\n<p>Diagnosis may also be difficult&nbsp;because&nbsp;symptoms can vary greatly from person to person, and they may change over time. For example, there may be periods where your symptoms are not very noticeable, or times when they flare up and become more severe.</p>\n<p>For a confident diagnosis of SLE to be made, you will need to have several&nbsp;<a>symptoms of lupus</a>&nbsp;and a number of&nbsp;<a>blood tests</a>&nbsp;may need to be carried out.</p>\n<h2>Blood tests</h2>\n<p>Some of the blood tests that may be carried out are described below.</p>\n<h3>Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) test</h3>\n<p>A blood test called the&nbsp;erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) test can be used to&nbsp;determine whether there is any inflammation in your body.</p>\n<p>This can be useful in diagnosing SLE because the condition can cause&nbsp;many areas of the body to become inflamed (swell), including&nbsp;the joints and internal organs.</p>\n<p>The test works by measuring how long it takes for red blood cells to fall to the bottom of&nbsp;a test tube. The quicker they fall, the more likely it is that there are high levels of inflammation.</p>\n<h3>Anti-nuclear antibody test</h3>\n<p>An anti-nuclear antibody test checks&nbsp;whether there is a certain type of antibody cell in your blood, known as the anti-nuclear antibody. Approximately 95% of people with SLE have this antibody.</p>\n<p>However, it is possible to have the anti-nuclear antibody without having SLE, so the anti-nuclear antibody test is not a definitive way of testing for the condition.&nbsp;Other blood tests will also be needed to confirm the diagnosis.</p>\n<h3>Anti-DNA antibody test</h3>\n<p>An anti-DNA test also checks for a certain type of antibody in your blood, known as the anti-DNA antibody. If you have the anti-DNA antibody, it is highly likely that you have SLE. However, the antibody is only found in around 70% of people with the condition.</p>\n<p>The level of anti-DNA antibodies increases when SLE is more active, so during a flare-up of symptoms your reading from this test may be greater than normal.</p>\n<h3>Complement level test</h3>\n<p>Complement is a chemical in the blood that forms part of your immune system.&nbsp;The level of this chemical may be tested to check how active your SLE is. The level of complement in your blood decreases when SLE is more active.</p>\n<h2>Other tests</h2>\n<p>Once you have been diagnosed with SLE, you will normally need regular&nbsp;monitoring to see&nbsp;how the condition is affecting your body.</p>\n<p>If you have SLE it is possible you may&nbsp;develop other conditions, such as kidney problems. Monitoring your condition will allow your doctor to check for these complications and, if necessary, treat them as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>You may need to have scans, such as an&nbsp;<a>X-ray</a>,&nbsp;<a>ultrasound scan</a>,&nbsp;<a>magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan</a>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<a >computerised tomography (CT) scan</a>&nbsp;to check whether SLE is affecting your internal organs.</p>\n<h2>Treating lupus</h2>\n<p>There is currently no cure for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but treatments that can ease the symptoms and make it easier to live with are available.</p>\n<p>In most cases, treatment will involve a combination of self-care measures and medication.</p>\n<h2>Protecting yourself from the sun</h2>\n<p>Exposure to sunlight can sometimes make symptoms such as rashes worse, and it\'s&nbsp;important to protect your skin when&nbsp;in the sun.</p>\n<p>This means wearing clothing that covers your skin, a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses. You will also need to apply sunscreen with a high SPF to prevent sunburn. However, some people with lupus&nbsp;are not sun-sensitive and do not need to take extra precautions.</p>\n<p>As people get most of their&nbsp;vitamin D&nbsp;as a result of&nbsp;direct sunlight on&nbsp;the skin, there is a risk you&nbsp;may not get enough of this vitamin if you need to avoid sun exposure.&nbsp;This means you may need to make an extra effort to include good sources of vitamin D in your diet to avoid problems such as&nbsp;<a>osteoporosis</a>&nbsp;(weakened bones), and you may be advised to take vitamin D supplements.</p>\n<h2>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</h2>\n<p><a>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</a>&nbsp;are a common painkilling medication that reduces inflammation in the body. If you experience joint or muscle pain as a result of SLE, you may be prescribed a NSAID to help ease your symptoms.</p>\n<p>Commonly prescribed NSAIDs for SLE include&nbsp;<a>ibuprofen</a>, naproxen&nbsp;and diclofenac.</p>\n<p>You can buy some NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, over the counter. These NSAIDs may be suitable if your joint or muscle pain is mild. For more severe pain, you will need stronger medication prescribed by your GP.</p>\n<p>NSAIDs may not be suitable for people who have stomach, kidney or liver problems, or have had these problems in the past. They may also be unsuitable for people with asthma. Your GP will advise&nbsp;about which NSAID is right&nbsp;for you.</p>\n<h3>Side effects</h3>\n<p>If taken in high doses or over long periods of time, NSAIDs can damage your stomach lining, which may cause internal bleeding.</p>\n<p>If you need to take NSAIDs on a long-term basis, your GP will carefully monitor you to check for any problems, and you may be prescribed an additional medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to protect your stomach.</p>\n<h2>Hydroxychloroquine</h2>\n<p>Hydroxychloroquine&nbsp;is a medicine&nbsp;that has been&nbsp;used to treat&nbsp;<a>malaria</a>, but&nbsp;is also effective in treating some of the symptoms of SLE, such as rashes, joint and muscle pain, and fatigue.</p>\n<p>You will usually have to take hydroxychloroquine for 6 to 12 weeks before you&nbsp;notice any benefit.</p>\n<p>Most expert doctors recommend&nbsp;people with SLE take hydroxychloroquine on a long-term basis as a way of controlling their symptoms, helping to prevent flare-ups and to prevent development of more serious problems from lupus.</p>\n<h3>Side effects</h3>\n<p>Side effects of hydroxychloroquine are uncommon, but may include&nbsp;<a>indigestion</a>,&nbsp;<a>diarrhoea</a>,&nbsp;<a>headaches</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;rashes.</p>\n<p>Hydroxychloroquine may also cause more serious side effects in a small number of people. For example, in rare cases, this medicine can cause&nbsp;eye damage. Contact your GP or specialist immediately if you experience vision problems while taking hydroxychloroquine.</p>\n<p>If your GP or specialist feels it is necessary, you may need regular eye examinations.</p>\n<h2>Corticosteroids</h2>\n<p><a>Corticosteroids</a>&nbsp;are&nbsp;a type of medicine that help reduce inflammation quickly. They can be very effective in treating symptoms of SLE, but are usually only prescribed if the condition is severe.</p>\n<p>If you have severe symptoms of SLE, or if you are experiencing a flare-up, you may be given a large dose of corticosteroids to help bring your symptoms under control. As your symptoms ease, your dosage can gradually be reduced.</p>\n<h3>Side effects</h3>\n<p>When prescribing corticosteroids, the lowest effective dosage is always given. This is because high doses or long-term use of corticosteroids can cause side effects. These may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>thinning of your bones</li>\n<li>thinning of your skin</li>\n<li>weight gain</li>\n<li><a>high blood pressure</a>&nbsp;(hypertension)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Corticosteroids are a safe and effective form of treatment, provided&nbsp;they are taken correctly and under the supervision of your GP or specialist. They will tailor the steroid dose to your disease activity, to minimise side effects while effectively controlling the condition.</p>\n<h2>Immunosuppressants</h2>\n<p>Immunosuppressants are a type of medicine that suppress your immune system. They can help improve your symptoms of SLE by limiting the damage&nbsp;your immune system causes when it attacks healthy parts of your body.</p>\n<p>Commonly prescribed immunosuppressant medicines include azathioprine,&nbsp;methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil&nbsp;and cyclophosphamide.</p>\n<p>Immunosuppressants are sometimes used in conjunction with corticosteroids (see above) because these medicines may ease your symptoms more effectively when used together. Alternatively, the use of immunosuppressant medication may allow your corticosteroid dose to be reduced.</p>\n<h3>Side effects</h3>\n<p>Immunosuppressant medication is usually only prescribed if you have severe SLE. This is because this type of medication is powerful and can cause side effects such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>loss of appetite</li>\n<li>vomiting</li>\n<li>diarrhoea</li>\n<li>swollen gums</li>\n<li>bruising or bleeding more easily</li>\n<li>headache</li>\n<li><a>acne</a></li>\n<li>extra hair growth</li>\n<li>weight gain</li>\n<li>liver damage</li>\n<li>an increased risk of infection (see below)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclophosphamide can also cause birth defects if they are taken during pregnancy, so you should use a reliable form of contraception if you are taking these medications and are sexually active. If you are trying to become pregnant, an alternative medication such as azathioprine can be used.</p>\n<p>Tell your GP if a side effect becomes particularly troublesome, as&nbsp;it may mean your dose needs to be adjusted.</p>\n<h3>Infection risk</h3>\n<p>Taking immunosuppressant medication can increase your risk of developing an infection. This is a particularly serious&nbsp;concern for people with SLE, because the organ damage that can occur as a result&nbsp;of the condition means infections are more likely to be life-threatening.</p>\n<p>It is therefore&nbsp;very important to report any&nbsp;symptoms of a possible infection to your GP immediately.</p>\n<p>Symptoms of infection may sometimes be similar to a flare up of&nbsp;SLE and include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a fever (high temperature)</li>\n<li>a&nbsp;<a>cough</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>breathlessness</a></li>\n<li>burning when passing urine or&nbsp;passing blood in&nbsp;your urine</li>\n<li>diarrhoea</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should also try to avoid contact with anyone known to have an infection &ndash; even if it is an infection you were previously immune to, such as&nbsp;<a>chickenpox</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>measles</a>.&nbsp;This is because your previous immunity to these conditions will probably be suppressed (lowered).</p>\n<h2>Rituximab</h2>\n<p>Rituximab&nbsp;is a new type of medication&nbsp;used in people with severe SLE&nbsp;that&nbsp;doesn\'t respond to other treatments.</p>\n<p>Rituximab was originally designed to treat certain types of cancer, such as&nbsp;<a>lymphoma</a>, but it has since proved effective in treating a number of autoimmune conditions, such as SLE and&nbsp;<a>rheumatoid arthritis</a>.</p>\n<p>Rituximab works by locking on to and killing cells called \"B-cells\", which produce antibodies responsible for the symptoms of SLE. It is administered directly into your vein over the course of several hours, known as an infusion.</p>\n<p>Rituximab is not currently licensed for treating SLE in the UK, but your specialist may consider it an appropriate treatment for you. If your doctor suggests using rituximab, they should tell you that there are currently some uncertainties about how effective or safe&nbsp;it is in treating SLE.</p>\n<h3>Side effects</h3>\n<p>Common side effects of rituximab include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a>flu</a>-like symptoms, such as chills and a high temperature</li>\n<li>dizziness</li>\n<li>vomiting</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In rare cases, rituximab can cause a more serious allergy-like reaction. Most reactions occur during or shortly after the treatment is given, so you will be closely monitored once your treatment begins.</p>\n<h2>Belimumab</h2>\n<p>Belimumab is a new medication given to people with active SLE who don&rsquo;t respond to other treatments.</p>\n<p>It&nbsp;works by binding to growth factors that are needed for the survival of B-cells. It is given directly into your vein over several hours, known as an infusion. The first 3&nbsp;doses are given 14 days apart, and&nbsp;the medication is usually given once a month thereafter.</p>\n<p>Belimumab is licensed for treating SLE in the UK, and there may be instances where your specialist may consider it an appropriate treatment for you. If your doctor suggests using belimumab, they should tell you that there are currently some uncertainties about how effective or safe it is in treating SLE.</p>\n<h3>Side effects</h3>\n<p>Common side effects of belimumab include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>flu-like symptoms, such as chills and a high temperature</li>\n<li>nausea and diarrhoea</li>\n<li>headache</li>\n<li>difficulty sleeping (<a>insomnia</a>)</li>\n<li>a cough,&nbsp;<a>sore throat</a>&nbsp;and blocked or runny nose</li>\n<li>joint pain</li>\n<li>increased risk of infections</li>\n<li>changes in blood pressure</li>\n</ul>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(116,115,NULL,NULL,'<h2>Symptoms of Sjogren\'s syndrome</h2>\n<p>The most commonly reported symptoms of Sj&ouml;gren\'s syndrome are a dry mouth and eyes, which can lead to other associated symptoms.</p>\n<p>However, these symptoms can be common in old age, and most people with&nbsp;dry eyes or a dry mouth do not have Sj&ouml;gren\'s syndrome.</p>\n<p>Many women also experience vaginal dryness, which can make sex painful.</p>\n<h2>Associated symptoms of dry mouth</h2>\n<p>A&nbsp;<a>dry mouth</a>&nbsp;can lead to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a>tooth decay</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a>gum disease</a></li>\n<li>dry&nbsp;<a>cough</a></li>\n<li>difficulty swallowing and chewing</li>\n<li>hoarse voice</li>\n<li>difficulty speaking</li>\n<li>swollen salivary glands (located between your jaw and ears)</li>\n<li>repeated fungal infections in the mouth (<a>oral thrush</a>) &ndash; symptoms of which can include a coated or white tongue</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Associated symptoms of dry eyes</h2>\n<p>Dry eyes can lead to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>burning or stinging eyes</li>\n<li>itchy eyes</li>\n<li>a feeling that there\'s grit in your eyes</li>\n<li>irritated and swollen eyelids</li>\n<li>sensitivity to light (photophobia)</li>\n<li>tired eyes</li>\n<li>mucus&nbsp;discharge from your eyes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These symptoms can get worse when you\'re:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>in a windy or smoky environment</li>\n<li>in an air-conditioned building</li>\n<li>travelling on aeroplane</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Other symptoms of Sj&ouml;gren\'s syndrome</h2>\n<p>In more serious cases of Sj&ouml;gren\'s syndrome, the immune system can attack other parts of the body, causing symptoms and conditions such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>dry skin</li>\n<li>tiredness and fatigue &ndash; which are common and can lead to total exhaustion</li>\n<li>muscle pain</li>\n<li>joint pain, stiffness and swelling</li>\n<li>vasculitis&nbsp;(inflammation of blood vessels)</li>\n<li>difficulty concentrating, remembering and reasoning</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Causes of Sjogren\'s syndrome</h2>\n<p>It\'s not known exactly what causes Sj&ouml;gren\'s syndrome, but it\'s thought to be linked to a problem with the immune system.</p>\n<h2>The immune system</h2>\n<p>Your immune system usually helps protect the body from infection and illness by making antibodies. Antibodies attack bacteria and viruses, which help stop you from becoming ill.</p>\n<p>An autoimmune condition causes your immune system to react abnormally. Instead of attacking foreign cells, such as bacteria, the antibodies start attacking your body\'s healthy cells and tissue.</p>\n<p>In Sj&ouml;gren\'s syndrome, the parts of the body usually affected are the tear, saliva and vaginal glands, which are collectively known as the exocrine glands.</p>\n<p>The antibodies damage the exocrine glands so they can no longer function normally. There\'s some evidence that the immune system also damages the nerves that control these glands, which further reduces their effectiveness.</p>\n<p>The immune system can go on to damage other parts of the body, such as muscles, joints, blood vessels, nerves and, less commonly, organs.</p>\n<h2>Possible triggers for Sj&ouml;gren\'s syndrome</h2>\n<h3>Primary Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome</h3>\n<p>Most researchers believe that primary Sj&ouml;gren\'s syndrome is triggered by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.</p>\n<p>Certain people are born with specific genes that make them more vulnerable to a faulty immune system. Then, many years later, an environmental factor, possibly a common virus, triggers the immune system to stop working properly.</p>\n<p>The female hormone oestrogen also seems to play&nbsp;a role. Sj&ouml;gren\'s syndrome mostly occurs in women, and symptoms usually start around the time of the&nbsp;<a>menopause</a>, when oestrogen levels begin to fall. Falling oestrogen levels can contribute to dryness, and this dryness&nbsp;could make the&nbsp;condition more noticeable.</p>\n<h3>Secondary Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome</h3>\n<p>Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome can be associated with other autoimmune conditions, such as&nbsp;<a>rheumatoid arthritis</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>lupus</a>. This is known as secondary Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome.</p>\n<h2>The exocrine glands</h2>\n<p>Your saliva and tear glands play a vital role in protecting your mouth and eyes, which is why the symptoms of&nbsp;Sj&ouml;gren\'s syndrome can be widespread and troublesome.</p>\n<h3>The importance of tears</h3>\n<p>We usually only notice our tears when we cry, but our eyes are always covered by a thin layer of tears, known as a tear film.</p>\n<p>Tears are made up of a mix of water, proteins, fats, mucus and infection-fighting cells. Tears serve several important functions. They:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>lubricate the eye</li>\n<li>keep the eye clean and free of dust</li>\n<li>protect the eye against infection</li>\n<li>help stabilise your vision</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The importance of saliva</h3>\n<p>Saliva also serves several important functions, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>keeping the mouth and throat naturally lubricated</li>\n<li>aiding digestion by moistening food and containing enzymes that can break down certain starches</li>\n<li>acting as a natural disinfectant (saliva contains antibodies, enzymes and proteins that protect against some common bacterial and fungal infections)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Diagnosing Sjogren\'s syndrome</h2>\n<p>Sj&ouml;gren\'s syndrome can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms are similar to those of other health conditions.</p>\n<p>You may see different health professionals&nbsp;for your&nbsp;different symptoms, such as a dentist for a&nbsp;<a>dry mouth</a>, an optician for&nbsp;dry eyes and a gynaecologist for&nbsp;a&nbsp;dry vagina, which can sometimes make it difficult to reach a firm diagnosis.</p>\n<p>See&nbsp;your GP if you experience any symptoms of dryness, particularly of your eyes and mouth.</p>\n<h2>Screening questions</h2>\n<p>Experts in the field have come up with a series of screening questions, which may be useful if you\'re worried you may have Sj&ouml;gren\'s syndrome.</p>\n<p>If you answer \"yes\" to most of the questions below, you may have Sj&ouml;gren\'s syndrome and will probably be advised to have further tests.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have you had daily, persistent, troublesome dry eyes for more than three months?</li>\n<li>Do you keep having a sensation of grit in your eye?</li>\n<li>Do you need to use eye drops containing tear substitutes more than three times a day?</li>\n<li>Have you had a daily feeling of dry mouth for more than three months?</li>\n<li>Do you keep getting swollen salivary glands (located between your jaw and your ears)?</li>\n<li>Do you frequently drink liquids to help you swallow food?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Further testing</h2>\n<p>Tests used to diagnose&nbsp;Sj&ouml;gren\'s syndrome include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>tear break-up time and Schirmer tests</li>\n<li>a lip biopsy</li>\n<li>blood tests</li>\n<li>salivary flow rate</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are explained below.</p>\n<h3>Tear break-up time and Schirmer tests</h3>\n<p>Tear break-up time and Schirmer tests are usually carried out by an ophthalmologist (a doctor who specialises in treating eye conditions).</p>\n<p>The tear break-up time test measures how effective your tear glands are.&nbsp;A non-toxic dye is dropped onto the surface of your eye and the&nbsp;colour of the dye allows the ophthalmologist to see how well your tear film is functioning and how long it takes for your tears to evaporate.</p>\n<p>This test is also carried out&nbsp;using a slit lamp. A slit lamp is a low-power microscope with a high-intensity light source that can be focused to shine in a&nbsp;narrow beam. The specialist will use the slit lamp to examine your tear glands more closely.</p>\n<p>In the Schirmer test, small strips of blotting paper are placed into your lower eyelid. After five minutes, the strips are removed to see how much of the paper is soaked with tears.</p>\n<h3>Lip biopsy</h3>\n<p>During a lip&nbsp;<a>biopsy</a>, a small tissue&nbsp;sample&nbsp;is removed from your inner lip and examined under a microscope. A&nbsp;<a>local anaesthetic</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;injected into&nbsp;the inner surface of your lower lip to numb the area, before a small cut is made to remove a few of your minor salivary glands.</p>\n<p>Clusters of lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) in the tissue can indicate Sj&ouml;gren\'s syndrome.</p>\n<h3>Blood tests</h3>\n<p><a>Blood tests</a>&nbsp;are carried out to look for antibodies known as anti-Ro and anti-La (or SS-A and SS-B), which are produced when the immune system has been affected by Sj&ouml;gren\'s syndrome.</p>\n<p>These antibodies are only present in about 60% of people with Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome, so it\'s possible to have a negative blood test result and still have the condition.</p>\n<h3>Salivary flow rate</h3>\n<p>A salivary flow rate test measures how much saliva your glands produce.</p>\n<p>You\'ll usually be asked to spit as much saliva as you can into a cup&nbsp;over a five-minute period. The amount of saliva is then weighed or measured. An unusually low flow rate can indicate Sj&ouml;gren\'s syndrome.</p>\n<h2>Treating Sjogren\'s syndrome</h2>\n<p>There\'s no cure for Sj&ouml;gren\'s syndrome, but treatments help relieve symptoms such as eye and mouth dryness.</p>\n<p>Sj&ouml;gren\'s syndrome affects everyone in different ways, so your treatment plan will be&nbsp;tailored to suit you.</p>\n<h2>Eye care</h2>\n<h3>Artificial tears</h3>\n<p>Mild to moderate cases of dry eye can usually be successfully treated with eye drops containing \"artificial tears\" &ndash; a liquid that mimics tears. These eye drops are available from a pharmacist, without a prescription.</p>\n<p>There are many different types of eye drops, so you can try different brands to find the one that works best for you. If you\'re using eye drops regularly (more than three times a day), you should use one that doesn\'t contain&nbsp;preservatives. This is because there\'s evidence that over-exposure to preservatives can damage the surface of the eye.</p>\n<p>A short-term dose of eye drops containing&nbsp;<a>corticosteroids</a>&nbsp;may be recommended if your eyes become irritated. However,&nbsp;long-term corticosteroid use isn\'t recommended because they can cause serious side effects.</p>\n<p>To minimise the chance of experiencing side effects from corticosteroids, you\'ll be prescribed the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time.</p>\n<h3>Moisture chamber spectacles</h3>\n<p>Wearing glasses reduces tear evaporation by up to 30%, and this effect can be maximised by wearing specially-made glasses called moisture chamber spectacles. These wrap around your eyes like goggles and help retain moisture and protect the eyes from irritants.</p>\n<p>Some people used to be embarrassed to&nbsp;wear them, but modern designs look like sports glasses.</p>\n<h3>Punctal plugs</h3>\n<p>Punctual occlusion is a widely-used technique that seals the tear ducts (into which the tears drain) with small plugs. This should help keep&nbsp;the eye better protected by tears.</p>\n<p>Temporary plugs made of silicone are usually used first to see if they help. If it does, more permanent plugs can be used.</p>\n<h2>Mouth care</h2>\n<h3>Looking after your mouth</h3>\n<p>A&nbsp;number of techniques can be used to keep your mouth lubricated, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>maintaining good oral hygiene to&nbsp;<a>prevent tooth decay</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a>gum disease</a></li>\n<li>increasing your fluid intake</li>\n<li>using sugar-free chewing gum to stimulate saliva production</li>\n<li>sucking ice cubes to help lubricate your mouth and reduce dryness</li>\n<li>regularly using mouth rinses to soothe&nbsp;your mouth and protect it against infection</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you smoke, you should try to quit. Smoking irritates the mouth and increases the rate at which saliva evaporates.</p>\n<h3>Saliva substitutes</h3>\n<p>There are a number of saliva substitute products that can help lubricate your mouth. However, they don\'t replicate the role of&nbsp;saliva in preventing infection, so you\'ll still need to maintain excellent oral hygiene.</p>\n<p>Saliva substitutes are available as a spray, lozenge (medicated sweet), gel, or gum. Your GP or pharmacist can tell you which product is most suitable for you.</p>\n<h2>Medication for Sj&ouml;gren\'s syndrome</h2>\n<h3>Pilocarpine</h3>\n<p>The medicine pilocarpine is often used to treat the&nbsp;<a>symptoms of dry eyes and dry mouth</a>. Pilocarpine stimulates the glands to produce more saliva and tears.</p>\n<p>Side effects of pilocarpine include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a>hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating)</a></li>\n<li>nausea</li>\n<li><a>diarrhoea</a>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>heartburn</li>\n<li>abdominal (stomach) pain</li>\n<li>an increased need to go to the toilet</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For some people, the side effects of pilocarpine are mild. Others find that the side effects outweigh the benefits.</p>\n<p>Don\'t take pilocarpine if you have&nbsp;<a>asthma</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</a>, or if you\'re pregnant or breastfeeding.</p>\n<h3>Hydroxychloroquine</h3>\n<p>Hydroxychloroquine has been shown to slow down the immune system\'s attack on the tear and saliva glands. It can also help reduce any associated symptoms of muscle pain, joint pain and stiffness.</p>\n<p>You\'ll need to take hydroxychloroquine for several weeks before you notice any improvements, and it could be six months before you experience the full benefit of the treatment.</p>\n<p>Side effects are uncommon and usually mild. They include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>nausea</li>\n<li>skin rash</li>\n<li>loss of appetite</li>\n<li>stomach cramps</li>\n<li>vomiting</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In very rare cases, hydroxychloroquine can damage the retina, affecting vision. You\'ll probably be asked to attend an eye examination so that your retina can be checked before you start treatment. Regular eye examinations (usually at least once a year) are also recommended after you begin treatment.</p>\n<p>Hydroxychloroquine shouldn\'t be used by breastfeeding women.</p>\n<h2>Treating other symptoms of Sj&ouml;gren\'s syndrome</h2>\n<h3>Dry skin</h3>\n<p>Several soaps and creams are specifically designed for people with dry skin. Your pharmacist or GP can advise you.</p>\n<h3>Vaginal dryness</h3>\n<p>Vaginal dryness can be treated using a lubricant. Some women also use oestrogen creams or&nbsp;<a>hormone replacement therapy (HRT)</a>.</p>\n<h3>Muscle and joint pains</h3>\n<p>Muscle and joint pains can be treated with an over-the-counter&nbsp;<a>non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)</a>, such as&nbsp;<a>ibuprofen</a>. If this doesn\'t work, see your GP, as stronger NSAIDs are available on prescription.</p>\n<p>NSAIDs can increase your risk of developing&nbsp;<a>stomach ulcers</a>&nbsp;and internal bleeding, particularly if they\'re taken on a long-term basis.</p>\n<p>If you find swallowing NSAIDs difficult because of your dry mouth, you can try an NSAID cream that\'s rubbed into affected joints.</p>\n<p>NSAIDs aren\'t recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women, or for people with pre-existing risk factors for cardiovascular or kidney conditions.</p>\n<h2>General advice</h2>\n<p>These&nbsp;simple tips can help prevent many of the problems associated with Sj&ouml;gren\'s syndrome:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>have a dental check-up every six months</li>\n<li>practise good dental hygiene &ndash; brushing, flossing and using mouthwash regularly</li>\n<li>avoid eating too many sweet foods</li>\n<li>avoid strong and perfumed soaps &ndash; use special creams and soaps from your pharmacist</li>\n<li>avoid dry environments, such as air-conditioned offices, whenever possible</li>\n</ul>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(117,116,NULL,NULL,'<h2>Symptoms of Addison&rsquo;s disease</h2>\n<p>Addison\'s disease can be difficult to detect at first, because early symptoms are similar to symptoms of many other health conditions.</p>\n<p>Initial symptoms of Addison\'s disease can&nbsp;include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>fatigue (lack of energy or motivation)</li>\n<li>lethargy (abnormal drowsiness or tiredness)</li>\n<li>muscle weakness</li>\n<li>low mood (mild&nbsp;<a>depression</a>) or irritability</li>\n<li>loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss</li>\n<li>the need to urinate frequently</li>\n<li>increased thirst</li>\n<li>craving for salty foods</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a>Dehydration</a>&nbsp;can also be an early sign of Addison&rsquo;s disease. It\'s caused by lack of the hormone aldosterone in your body, which is used to regulate the balance of salt and water.</p>\n<h2>Later symptoms</h2>\n<p>Further&nbsp;symptoms of Addison&rsquo;s disease tend to develop gradually over months or years. However,&nbsp;additional strees, caused by another illness or an accident, for example, may cause your symptoms to suddenly get worse.</p>\n<p>You may go on to develop:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a>low blood pressure</a>&nbsp;when you stand up, which can cause dizziness and fainting&nbsp;</li>\n<li>feeling sick (nausea)</li>\n<li>vomiting</li>\n<li><a >diarrhoea</a></li>\n<li>abdominal,&nbsp;joint or back pain</li>\n<li>muscle cramps&nbsp;</li>\n<li>chronic exhaustion, which may cause depression</li>\n<li>brownish discolouration of the skin, lips&nbsp;and gums (hyperpigmentation), particularly in the creases on your palms, on scars or on pressure points, such as your knuckles or knees</li>\n<li>a&nbsp;<a>reduced libido (lack of interest in sex)</a>, particularly in women</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some women may also have irregular periods&nbsp;or miss some periods completely.&nbsp;Children with Addison\'s disease may experience puberty&nbsp;later than usual.</p>\n<p>Some people with Addison\'s disease also develop&nbsp;<a>low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)</a>. This can cause symptoms such as&nbsp;difficulty concentrating, confusion, anxiety and even unconsciousness (particularly in children).</p>\n<p>If you\'re experiencing&nbsp;symptoms of Addison\'s disease, see your GP so they can diagnose or rule out the condition.&nbsp;These symptoms&nbsp;will usually improve with&nbsp;appropriate treatment.</p>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;<a>diagnosing Addison\'s disease</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a>treating Addison\'s disease</a></p>\n<h2>Adrenal crisis</h2>\n<p>If Addison&rsquo;s disease is left untreated, the levels of hormones produced by the adrenal gland&nbsp;gradually decrease in the body. This causes your symptoms to get progressively worse and eventually lead to a life-threatening situation&nbsp;called&nbsp;an adrenal or Addisonian crisis.</p>\n<p>During an adrenal crisis, the symptoms of Addison&rsquo;s disease appear quickly and&nbsp;severely. This could happen when&nbsp;you\'re already experiencing initial symptoms or without any symptoms at all.</p>\n<p>Signs of an adrenal crisis include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>severe&nbsp;<a>dehydration</a></li>\n<li>pale, cold, clammy skin</li>\n<li>sweating</li>\n<li>rapid, shallow breathing</li>\n<li>dizziness</li>\n<li>severe vomiting and&nbsp;<a>diarrhoea</a></li>\n<li>severe muscle weakness</li>\n<li><a>headache</a></li>\n<li>severe drowsiness or loss of consciousness</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An adrenal crisis is a medical emergency. If left untreated, it can be fatal. If you think you or someone you know&nbsp;with Addison&rsquo;s disease&nbsp;is having an adrenal crisis, dial 999 for an ambulance.</p>\n<p>If an adrenal crisis isn\'t treated, it can lead to a&nbsp;<a>coma</a>&nbsp;and death. There\'s also a risk your brain won\'t get enough oxygen if treatment is delayed, which&nbsp;can cause permanent disability.</p>\n<h2>Causes of Addison&rsquo;s disease</h2>\n<p>Addison\'s disease develops when the outer layer of your adrenal glands (your adrenal cortex) is damaged, reducing the levels of hormones it produces.</p>\n<h2>Problems with the immune system</h2>\n<p>In the UK, a problem with the immune system is the most common cause of Addison\'s disease, accounting for 70-90% of cases.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;immune system is your body&rsquo;s defence against infection and disease. If you\'re ill, your immune system produces antibodies (a special type of protein that destroys disease-carrying organisms and toxins). These antibodies attack the cause of the illness.</p>\n<p>However, if you develop a problem with your immune system, it can start to attack your own healthy tissues and organs. This is known as an autoimmune disorder.</p>\n<p>Addison&rsquo;s disease can develop if your immune system attacks your adrenal glands and severely damages your adrenal cortex. When 90% of the adrenal cortex is destroyed, your adrenal glands won\'t be able to produce enough of the steroid hormones cortisol and aldosterone. Once levels of these start decreasing, you\'ll experience&nbsp;<a >symptoms of Addison&rsquo;s disease</a>.</p>\n<p>It\'s not clear why some people develop this problem with their immune system, although it can run in families (see below).</p>\n<h2>Genetics</h2>\n<p>Research has shown that some people with&nbsp;certain genes&nbsp;are more likely to develop autoimmune disorders.</p>\n<p>It\'s not clear how these genes lead to Addison\'s disease&nbsp;and&nbsp;similar conditions, but it does mean&nbsp;your risk of developing Addison\'s disease is increased if you or a&nbsp;close family member&nbsp;have another autoimmune condition, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>vitiligo&ndash; a chronic (long-term) condition that causes pale, white patches to develop on the skin</li>\n<li><a>type 1 diabetes</a>&nbsp;&ndash; a chronic condition caused by too much glucose in the blood&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li><a>underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)</a>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Other causes</h2>\n<p><a >Tuberculosis (TB)</a>&nbsp;is the most common cause of Addison\'s disease worldwide, but is rare in the UK. TB is a bacterial infection that mostly affects the lungs, but can also spread to other parts of your body.&nbsp;It can cause Addison&rsquo;s disease if it damages your adrenal glands.</p>\n<p>Other possible causes of Addison&rsquo;s disease include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>infections &ndash; such as those linked to&nbsp;<a>AIDS</a>, or fungal infections</li>\n<li>a haemorrhage &ndash; very heavy bleeding into the adrenal glands, sometimes associated with&nbsp;<a>meningitis</a>&nbsp;or other types of severe&nbsp;<a>sepsis</a></li>\n<li>cancer &ndash; if&nbsp;<a>cancer</a>&nbsp;cells from elsewhere in your body spread to your adrenal glands</li>\n<li>amyloidosis &ndash; a disease where amyloid, a protein produced by your bone marrow cells, builds up in your adrenal glands and damages them</li>\n<li>surgical removal of&nbsp;both adrenal glands (adrenalectomy) &ndash; for example, to remove a tumour</li>\n<li>adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) &ndash; a rare, life-limiting, inherited condition affecting the adrenal glands and nerve cells in the brain that&nbsp;most often&nbsp;affects young boys</li>\n<li>certain treatments needed for Cushing\'s syndrome &ndash; a collection of symptoms caused by very high levels of cortisol in the body</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Treating Addison&rsquo;s disease</h2>\n<p>If you have Addison&rsquo;s disease, you\'ll need to take daily medication to replace the lost hormones. This should help you to live an active life, although many people find they still need to manage their fatigue.</p>\n<p>In&nbsp;some cases, the underlying causes of Addison&rsquo;s disease can be treated. For example,&nbsp;<a>tuberculosis (TB)</a>&nbsp;is treated with a course of&nbsp;<a>antibiotics</a>&nbsp;over a period of at least six months.</p>\n<p>However, most cases are caused by a problem with the immune system that can\'t be cured.</p>\n<h2>Medication for&nbsp;Addison&rsquo;s disease</h2>\n<p>Treatment usually involves&nbsp;<a>corticosteroid (steroid)</a>&nbsp;replacement therapy for life. Corticosteroid medication is used to replace the hormones cortisol and aldosterone that&nbsp;your body no longer produces.&nbsp;It\'s usually taken in tablet form two or three times a day.</p>\n<p>In most cases, a medication called&nbsp;hydrocortisone&nbsp;is used to replace the cortisol. Other possible medicines are&nbsp;prednisolone or dexamethasone, though these are less commonly used.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Aldosterone is replaced with a medication called fludrocortisone. Your GP may also ask you to add extra salt to your daily diet, although if you\'re taking enough fludrocortisone medicine this&nbsp;may not be necessary.&nbsp;Unlike most people, if you feel the urge to eat something salty, then you should eat it.</p>\n<p>In general, the medications used for Addison\'s disease don\'t have side effects, unless your dose is too high. If you take a higher dose than necessary for a long time, there\'s a risk of problems such as&nbsp;<a>weakened bones (osteoporosis)</a>, mood swings and&nbsp;<a>difficulty sleeping (insomnia)</a>.</p>\n<h2>Living with Addison&rsquo;s disease</h2>\n<p>Many people with Addison&rsquo;s disease find&nbsp;that taking their medication enables them to continue&nbsp;with their&nbsp;normal diet and exercise routines. However, bouts of fatigue are also common, and it can&nbsp;take some time to learn how to manage these periods of low energy.</p>\n<p>Some people find that needing to take regular doses of medication is restrictive and affects their daily life or emotional health.&nbsp;Missing a dose of medication, or taking it late,&nbsp;can also lead to exhaustion or insomnia.</p>\n<p>Some people can develop associated health conditions, such as&nbsp;<a>diabetes</a>&nbsp;or an&nbsp;<a>underactive thyroid</a>, which require extra treatment and management.</p>\n<p>You\'ll usually need to have appointments with an endocrinologist every 6-12 months, so they can review your progress and adjust your medication dose, if necessary.&nbsp;Your GP can provide support and repeat prescriptions in between these visits.</p>\n<p>Failing to take your medication could lead to a serious condition called an adrenal crisis, so&nbsp;you must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>remember to collect your repeat prescriptions</li>\n<li>keep spare medication as necessary &ndash; for example, in the car or at work, and always carry some spare medication with you</li>\n<li>take your medication every day at the right time</li>\n<li>pack extra medication if you are going away &ndash; usually double what you would normally need, plus your injection kit (see below)</li>\n<li>carry your medication in your hand luggage if you are travelling by plane, with a note from your doctor explaining why it is necessary</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You could also inform close friends or colleagues of your condition. Tell them about the signs of adrenal crisis and what they should do if you experience one.</p>\n<h3>Medical alert bracelets</h3>\n<p>It\'s also a good idea to wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace that informs people&nbsp;you have Addison&rsquo;s disease.</p>\n<p>After a serious accident, such as a car crash, a healthy person produces more&nbsp;cortisol. This helps you cope with the stressful situation and additional strain on your body that results from serious injury. As your body cannot produce cortisol, you\'ll need a hydrocortisone injection to replace it and prevent an adrenal crisis.</p>\n<p>Wearing a medical alert bracelet will inform any medical staff&nbsp;treating you about your condition, and what medication you require.</p>\n<p>Medical alert bracelets or necklaces are pieces of jewellery engraved with your medical condition and an emergency contact number. They are available from a number of retailers. Ask your GP if there\'s one they recommend, or go to the&nbsp;<a>MedicAlert</a>&nbsp;website.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you need to stay in hospital, the healthcare professionals responsible for your care will also need to know you need steroid replacement medication throughout your stay. It\'s important to note that this advice still applies if you\'re not supposed to eat or drink (nil by mouth) for any reason.</p>\n<h2>Adjusting your medication</h2>\n<p>At certain times, your medication may need to be adjusted to take into account any additional strain on your body. For example, you may need to increase the dosage of your medication if you experience any of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>an illness or infection &ndash; particularly if you have a high temperature of 37.5C (99.5F)</li>\n<li>an accident, such as a car crash</li>\n<li>an operation, dental or medical procedure (such as a tooth filling or endoscopy)</li>\n<li>you\'re taking part in strenuous exercise&nbsp;not usually part of your daily life</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This will help your body cope with the additional stress. Your endocrinologist will monitor your dosage and advise about any changes. Over time, as you get used to the condition and learn what can trigger your symptoms, you may learn how to adjust your medication yourself. However, always consult your GP or specialist if you\'re unsure.</p>\n<h2>Emergency treatment</h2>\n<p>You and a partner or family member may be trained to administer an injection of hydrocortisone in an emergency.</p>\n<p>This could be necessary if you go into shock&nbsp;after an injury, or if you experience vomiting or diarrhoea and are unable to keep down oral medication. This may occur if you\'re pregnant and have morning sickness. Your&nbsp;endocrinologist will discuss with you when an injection might be necessary.</p>\n<p>If you need to administer emergency hydrocortisone, always call your GP immediately afterwards. Check what&nbsp;<a>out-of-hours services</a>&nbsp;are available in your local area, in case the emergency is outside normal working hours.</p>\n<p>You can also&nbsp;register yourself with your local&nbsp;<a>ambulance service</a>, so they have a record of your requirement for a steroid injection or tablets, if you need their assistance.</p>\n<h2>Treating adrenal crisis</h2>\n<p>Adrenal crisis, or Addisonian crisis, needs urgent medical attention. Dial 999 for an ambulance if you or someone you know are experiencing adrenal crisis.</p>\n<p>Signs of an adrenal crisis include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>severe&nbsp;<a>dehydration</a></li>\n<li>pale, cold, clammy skin</li>\n<li>sweating</li>\n<li>rapid, shallow breathing</li>\n<li>dizziness</li>\n<li>severe vomiting and&nbsp;<a>diarrhoea</a></li>\n<li>severe muscle weakness</li>\n<li><a>headache</a></li>\n<li>severe drowsiness or loss of consciousness</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In hospital, you\'ll be given lots of fluid through a vein in your arm to rehydrate you. This will contain a mixture of salts and sugars (sodium, glucose and dextrose) to replace those that your body is lacking. You\'ll also be injected with hydrocortisone to replace the missing cortisol hormone.</p>\n<p>Any underlying causes of the adrenal crisis, such as an infection, will also be treated.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(118,117,NULL,NULL,'<h2>Symptoms of an overactive thyroid</h2>\n<p>An overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) has many signs and symptoms, although it is unlikely you would develop all of them.</p>\n<h2>Symptoms of hyperthyroidism</h2>\n<p>If you have hyperthyroidism, you may experience some of the following symptoms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>hyperactivity</li>\n<li>mood swings &ndash; such as&nbsp;<a>anxiety</a>, irritability and nervousness</li>\n<li><a>difficulty sleeping (insomnia)</a></li>\n<li>feeling tired all the time (fatique)</li>\n<li>muscle weakness</li>\n<li>needing to pass stools (faeces) or urine more&nbsp;frequently</li>\n<li>excess fats in your stools &ndash; which can make them greasy and difficult to flush down the toilet (steatorrhoea)</li>\n<li>sensitivity to heat and&nbsp;<a>excess sweating</a></li>\n<li>unexplained or unexpected weight loss &ndash; despite having an increased appetite (though in a small number of cases, the increase in appetite can lead to weight gain)</li>\n<li>very infrequent or light periods, or periods stopping altogether</li>\n<li>infertility</li>\n<li><a>loss of interest in sex</a>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have&nbsp;<a>diabetes</a>, your diabetic symptoms, such as extreme thirst and tiredness, may be made worse by hyperthyroidism.</p>\n<h2>Signs of hyperthyroidism</h2>\n<p>If you have hyperthyroidism, you may have some of the following physical signs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a swelling in your neck caused by an&nbsp;<a>enlarged thyroid gland (goitre)</a></li>\n<li>irregular and/or&nbsp;unusually fast heart rate (<a>palpitations</a>)</li>\n<li>trembling or shaking (tremor)</li>\n<li>warm, moist skin</li>\n<li>redness on the palms of your hands</li>\n<li>loosening of your nails in their nail beds</li>\n<li><a>hives (urticaria)</a></li>\n<li>patchy hair loss (alopecia)</li>\n<li>twitching in your face and limbs</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>When to seek medical advice</h2>\n<p>See your GP if you are experiencing any of the above. They may not be the result of an overactive thyroid gland, but they will need further investigation.</p>\n<p>It might be useful to make a list of your symptoms, as this can often be helpful in determining the correct diagnosis.</p>\n<h2>Causes of an overactive thyroid</h2>\n<p>Overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) occurs when your thyroid gland produces too much of the thyroid hormones thyroxine or triiodothyronine.</p>\n<p>Overproduction of thyroid hormones can be caused by a number of conditions, which are outlined below.</p>\n<h2>Graves\' disease</h2>\n<p>Graves\' disease is the most common cause of overactive thyroid. It can run in families and can occur at any age, although it is most common in women aged 20-40 years old. You are more likely to develop Graves\' disease if you smoke.</p>\n<p>Graves\' disease is an autoimmune condition.&nbsp;This means the immune system mistakes&nbsp;something&nbsp;in the body for a toxic substance and attacks it.</p>\n<p>In&nbsp;Graves\' disease,&nbsp;it attacks the&nbsp;thyroid gland, which&nbsp;leads to an overproduction of the thyroid hormones.</p>\n<p>It is not known what triggers the immune system to do this. Like many autoimmune conditions, it is thought that a combination of both genetic and environmental factors could be involved.</p>\n<p>If you have Graves\' disease, your eyes may also be affected, causing discomfort and double vision. This is known as Graves\' ophthalmopathy. You may find&nbsp;your eyes bulge out or appear more prominent.</p>\n<p>For more information on Graves\' ophthalmopathy, read our page on&nbsp;complications of an overactive thyroid gland.</p>\n<h2>Thyroid nodules</h2>\n<p>It is possible for lumps to develop in your thyroid gland. These are known as nodules. It is not known why nodules develop, but they are usually non-cancerous (benign).</p>\n<p>However, the nodules can contain abnormal thyroid tissue, which affects the normal production of thyroxine or triiodothyronine, causing an overactive thyroid. Nodules that contain abnormal thyroid tissue are described as toxic.</p>\n<p>Toxic thyroid nodules account for about&nbsp;1 in 20 cases of hyperthyroidism.</p>\n<h2>Iodine supplements</h2>\n<p>Iodine contained in the food you eat is used by your thyroid gland to produce the thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine. However, taking additional iodine in supplements can cause your thyroid gland to produce too much thyroxine or triiodothyronine.</p>\n<p>This is known as iodine-induced hyperthyroidism &ndash; sometimes referred to as Jod-Basedow phenomenon. It usually only occurs if you already have nodules in your thyroid gland.</p>\n<h2>Amiodarone</h2>\n<p>Amiodarone is a type of medication known as an anti-arrhythmic, which helps to control an&nbsp;<a>irregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation)</a>. If you have non-toxic nodules in your thyroid gland, taking amiodarone can cause hyperthyroidism because it contains iodine.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Amiodarone can cause a type of hyperthyroidism usually more severe and difficult to treat through a harmful effect on thyroid tissue. This type of hyperthyroidism is called amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism.</p>\n<h2>Follicular thyroid cancer</h2>\n<p>In rare cases, you may develop an overactive thyroid as a result of&nbsp;<a>thyroid cancer</a>&nbsp;that starts in your thyroid follicles. This can occur if cancer cells in your thyroid gland begin to produce thyroxine or triiodothyronine. This is also known as functioning thyroid cancer.</p>\n<h2>Treating an overactive thyroid</h2>\n<p>If you are diagnosed with an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism), your GP will refer you to a specialist in hormonal conditions (endocrinologist) to plan your treatment.</p>\n<p>The most widely used treatments for an overactive thyroid are outlined below.</p>\n<h2>Thionamides</h2>\n<p>Thionamides, such as carbimazole and propylthiouracil, are a common treatment. They are a type of medication that stops your thyroid gland producing excess amounts of thyroxine or triiodothyronine.</p>\n<p>As thionamides affect the production of thyroid hormone rather than their current levels, you will need to take them for several weeks before you notice an improvement (usually between four to eight weeks).</p>\n<p>Once the production of thyroid hormones is under control, your specialist may gradually reduce your medication.</p>\n<p>You may need to continue taking thionamides for a long time, until the condition is under control.</p>\n<p>Around 1 in 20 people will experience side effects when they first start taking thionamides, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>itchy skin rash</li>\n<li>joint pain</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These side effects should pass once your body is used to the effects of the medication.</p>\n<p>In rare cases (around 1 in 500), thionamides cause a sudden drop in white blood cells (agranulocytosis), which can make you extremely vulnerable to infection.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Symptoms of agranulocytosis include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>fever</li>\n<li><a>gum pain, swelling and bleeding</a>&nbsp;</li>\n<li><a>sore throat</a>&nbsp;</li>\n<li><a>mouth ulcers</a>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>persistent&nbsp;<a>cough</a></li>\n<li><a>shortness of breath</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are taking thionamides and you experience any of the symptoms above, call your GP immediately for advice and an urgent blood test. If this is not possible, call NHS&nbsp;<a href=\"tel:111\">111</a>&nbsp;service or your local out-of-hours service.</p>\n<h2>Beta-blockers</h2>\n<p><a>Beta-blockers,</a>&nbsp;such as propranolol or atenolol, can relieve some of the symptoms of an overactive thyroid, including tremor (shaking and trembling), rapid heartbeat and hyperactivity.</p>\n<p>Your specialist may prescribe you a beta-blocker while the condition is being diagnosed, or until&nbsp;thionamide brings your thyroid gland under control. However, beta-blockers are not suitable if you have asthma.</p>\n<p>Beta-blockers can sometimes cause side effects, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>feeling sick</li>\n<li>feeling tired all the time (fatigue)</li>\n<li>cold hands and feet</li>\n<li>trouble sleeping, sometimes with nightmares</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Radioiodine treatment</h2>\n<p>Radioiodine treatment is a form of radiotherapy used to treat most types of overactive thyroid. Radioactive iodine shrinks your thyroid gland, reducing the amount of thyroid hormone it can produce.</p>\n<p>Radioiodine treatment&nbsp;is&nbsp;given either as a drink or a capsule to swallow. The dose of radioactivity in the radioiodine is very low and is not harmful.</p>\n<p>Radioiodine treatment is not suitable if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, and may not be suitable if you have eye problems, such as double vision or prominent (bulging) eyes.</p>\n<p>Women should avoid getting pregnant for at least six months after having radioiodine treatment. Men should not father a child for at least four months after having radioiodine treatment.</p>\n<p>Most people only require a single dose of radioiodine treatment. If a further follow-up dose is required, it is usually given 6 to 12 months after the first dosage.</p>\n<p>A short course of thionamides treatment may be given a few weeks before radioiodine treatment, as this can lead to a more rapid relief of symptoms.</p>\n<h2>Thionamides or radioiodine?</h2>\n<p>In some cases, a particular treatment may be recommended based on factors such as your age, symptoms and the amount of extra thyroid hormone in your blood. However, there may be circumstances when you are offered a choice between a long-term course of thionamides or radioiodine treatment.</p>\n<p>Both treatments have advantages and disadvantages.</p>\n<p>Advantages of thionamides include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They are straightforward to take and you do not have to go to hospital to take them.</li>\n<li>There is less risk of getting an&nbsp;<a>underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)</a>&nbsp;as a result of treatment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Disadvantages of thionamides include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Treatment&nbsp;may not be as successful as radioiodine treatment.</li>\n<li>There is a higher risk of side effects.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Advantages of radioiodine treatment include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Treatment is usually very successful.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Disadvantages of radioiodine treatment include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is&nbsp;a higher chance of your thyroid gland becoming underactive as a result of treatment. &nbsp;</li>\n<li>Radioiodine treatment is usually not suitable for people with additional symptoms affecting their eyes (Graves\' ophthalmopathy).</li>\n<li>Women have to avoid getting pregnant for at least six months, and men should not father a child for at least four months after treatment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should discuss the potential risks and benefits of both types of treatment with the specialist in charge of your care.</p>\n<h2>Surgery</h2>\n<p>Surgery to remove all or part of the thyroid gland is known as a total or partial thyroidectomy. It is a permanent cure for recurrent overactive thyroid.</p>\n<p>Your specialist may recommend surgery if your thyroid gland is severely swollen (a large&nbsp;<a>goitre</a>) and is causing problems in your neck.</p>\n<p>Other reasons for surgery include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A person cannot be treated with radioiodine treatment as they are pregnant and are unable or unwilling to take&nbsp;thionamides. &nbsp;</li>\n<li>A person has a severe form of Graves\' ophthalmopathy.</li>\n<li>The symptoms return (relapse) after a previous successful course of treatment with thionamides.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is normally recommended that the entire thyroid gland is removed, as this means&nbsp;there will be no chance of a relapse.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(119,118,NULL,NULL,'<h2>About swollen glands</h2>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Swollen lymph glands are usually a sign of infection and tend to go down when you recover.&nbsp;However, they can sometimes have a more serious cause and may need to be seen by a doctor.</strong></p>\n<p>Lymph glands (also called lymph nodes) are&nbsp;pea-sized lumps of tissue that contain white blood cells.

Swollen glands, known medically as lymphadenopathy,&nbsp;may be felt under the chin or in the neck, armpits or&nbsp;groin, where they can be found in larger clumps.</p>\n<p>Many different types of infection can cause swollen glands, such as a&nbsp;<a>cold</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>glandular fever</a>. Less commonly, swollen glands may be caused by&nbsp;a non-infectious condition, such as&nbsp;<a>rheumatoid arthritis</a>&nbsp;or even cancer.</p>\n<h3>When to see your GP</h3>\n<p>See your GP if you have swollen glands and:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>they haven\'t gone down within a few weeks or are getting bigger</li>\n<li>they&nbsp;feel hard or don&rsquo;t move when you press them</li>\n<li>you also have a&nbsp;<a>sore throat</a>&nbsp;and find it difficult to swallow or breathe</li>\n<li>you also have unexplained weight loss,&nbsp;<a>night sweats</a>&nbsp;or a persistent high temperature (fever)</li>\n<li>you don\'t have an obvious infection and don\'t feel unwell</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If necessary, your GP may request some tests to&nbsp;help identify the cause. These can include&nbsp;<a>blood tests</a>, an&nbsp;<a>ultrasound scan</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>computerised tomography (CT) scan</a>, and/or a&nbsp;<a>biopsy</a>&nbsp;(where a small sample of fluid is taken from the&nbsp;swelling and tested).</p>\n<h3>Common causes of swollen glands</h3>\n<p>Swollen glands are usually caused by a relatively minor viral or bacterial infection, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a&nbsp;<a>cold</a></li>\n<li><a >tonsillitis</a></li>\n<li><a>glandular fever</a></li>\n<li>a&nbsp;<a>throat infection</a></li>\n<li>an&nbsp;<a>ear infection</a></li>\n<li>a&nbsp;<a>dental abscess</a></li>\n<li><a >cellulitis</a>&nbsp;(a skin infection)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The glands in&nbsp;the affected area&nbsp;will often become suddenly tender or painful. You may also have additional symptoms, such as a sore throat,&nbsp;<a>cough</a>,&nbsp;or fever.</p>\n<p>These&nbsp;infections usually clear up on their own, and the swollen glands will soon go down. You will normally just need to drink plenty of fluids, rest and relieve the symptoms at home using over-the-counter medicines such as&nbsp;<a>paracetamol</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>ibuprofen</a>.</p>\n<p>See your GP if your symptoms don\'t improve within&nbsp;a few weeks.</p>\n<h3>Less common causes of swollen glands</h3>\n<p>Less often, swollen glands&nbsp;may be the result of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>rubella&nbsp;&ndash; a viral infection that causes a red-pink skin rash made up of small spots</li>\n<li><a>measles</a>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;a highly infectious viral illness&nbsp;that causes distinctive&nbsp;red or brown spots on the skin&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>cytomegalovirus (CMV)&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;a common virus spread through bodily fluids, such as saliva and urine</li>\n<li><a>tuberculosis (TB)</a>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;a bacterial infection spread&nbsp;that causes a persistent cough&nbsp;</li>\n<li><a>syphilis</a>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;a bacterial infection&nbsp;usually caught by having sex with someone who is infected</li>\n<li>cat scratch disease&nbsp;&ndash; a bacterial infection caused by a scratch from an infected&nbsp;cat</li>\n<li><a>HIV</a>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;a virus&nbsp;that attacks the immune system and weakens your ability to fight infections</li>\n<li><a>lupus</a>&nbsp;&ndash; where the immune system starts to attack the body\'s joints, skin, blood cells and organs</li>\n<li><a>rheumatoid arthritis</a>&nbsp;&ndash; where the immune system starts to attack the tissue lining the joints</li>\n<li>sarcoidosis&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;where small patches of red and swollen tissue, called granulomas, develop in the organs of the body</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Click on the links above for more information&nbsp;on these conditions.</p>\n<h3>Could it be cancer?</h3>\n<p>Occasionally, swollen glands can be a sign of cancer that has started elsewhere in the body and spread to the lymph nodes, or a&nbsp;type of cancer affecting the white blood cells, such as&nbsp;<a>non-Hodgkin lymphoma</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>chronic lymphocytic leukaemia</a>.</p>\n<p>Swollen glands are more likely to be caused by cancer if they:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>don\'t go away within a few weeks and slowly get bigger</li>\n<li>are painless and firm or hard when you touch them</li>\n<li>occur&nbsp;with other symptoms, such as night sweats and weight loss</li>\n</ul>\n</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(120,119,NULL,NULL,'<ul>\n<li>\n<h2>Symptoms of an underactive thyroid</h2>\n<p>Many symptoms of an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) are the same as those of other conditions, so it can easily be confused for something else.</p>\n<p>Symptoms&nbsp;usually develop slowly and you may not realise you have a medical problem for several years.</p>\n<p>Common symptoms include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>tiredness</li>\n<li>being sensitive to cold</li>\n<li>weight gain</li>\n<li><a>constipation</a></li>\n<li><a>depression</a></li>\n<li>slow movements and thoughts</li>\n<li>muscle aches and weakness</li>\n<li>muscle cramps</li>\n<li>dry and scaly skin</li>\n<li>brittle hair and nails</li>\n<li><a>loss of libido (sex drive)</a></li>\n<li>pain, numbness and a tingling sensation in the hand and fingers (carpal tunnel syndrome)</li>\n<li>irregular periods&nbsp;or heavy periods</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Elderly people with an underactive thyroid may develop memory problems and depression. Children may experience slower growth and development. Teenagers may start&nbsp;puberty earlier than normal.</p>\n<p>If you have any of these symptoms, see your GP and ask to be tested for an underactive thyroid.</p>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;<a>getting tested for an underactive thyroid</a></p>\n<h2>If an underactive thyroid isn\'t treated</h2>\n<p>It\'s unlikely that you\'d have many of the later symptoms of an underactive thyroid, because the condition is often identified before more serious symptoms appear.</p>\n<p>Later symptoms of an underactive thyroid&nbsp;include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a low-pitched and hoarse voice</li>\n<li>a puffy-looking face</li>\n<li>thinned or partly missing eyebrows</li>\n<li>a slow heart rate</li>\n<li><a >hearing loss</a></li>\n<li><a>anaemia</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Causes of an underactive thyroid</h2>\n<p>An underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) is when your thyroid gland doesn\'t produce enough of the hormone thyroxine (also called T4).</p>\n<p>Most cases of an underactive thyroid are caused by the immune system attacking the thyroid gland and damaging it, or by damage that occurs as a result of&nbsp;treatments for&nbsp;<a>thyroid cancer</a>&nbsp;or an&nbsp;<a>overactive thyroid</a>.</p>\n<h2>Immune system</h2>\n<p>An underactive thyroid often occurs when the immune system, which usually fights infection, attacks the thyroid gland. This damages the thyroid, which means it\'s not able to make enough of the hormone thyroxine,&nbsp;leading to the&nbsp;<a>symptoms of an underactive thyroid</a>.</p>\n<p>A condition called Hashimoto\'s disease is the most common type of autoimmune reaction&nbsp;that&nbsp;causes an underactive thyroid.</p>\n<p>It\'s not clear what causes Hashimoto&rsquo;s disease, but it runs in families. It\'s also common in people with another immune system disorder, such as&nbsp;<a>type 1 diabetes</a>&nbsp;and vitiligo.</p>\n<h2>Previous thyroid treatment</h2>\n<p>An underactive thyroid can also occur as a side effect or complication of previous treatment to the thyroid gland, such as surgery or a treatment called radioactive iodine therapy.</p>\n<p>These treatments are sometimes used for an overactive thyroid&nbsp;(where the thyroid gland&nbsp;produces too much hormone) or thyroid cancer.</p>\n<h2>Less common causes</h2>\n<p>Worldwide,&nbsp;a&nbsp;lack of dietary&nbsp;iodine is a common cause of an underactive thyroid, because the body needs iodine to make thyroxine. However, iodine deficiency is&nbsp;uncommon in the UK.</p>\n<p>Babies are sometimes born with an underactive thyroid because the thyroid gland doesn\'t develop properly in the womb. This is called congenital hypothyroidism and is&nbsp;uncommon, affecting around 1 in 3,000 babies. It\'s&nbsp;usually picked up during routine screening soon after birth.</p>\n<p>A problem with the pituitary gland could lead to an underactive thyroid.&nbsp;The pituitary gland sits at the base of the brain and&nbsp;regulates the thyroid. Therefore, damage to the pituitary gland may lead to an underactive thyroid.</p>\n<p>An underactive thyroid has also been linked to&nbsp;some viral infections or some&nbsp;medications used to treat other conditions, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>lithium &ndash; a medication sometimes used to treat certain mental health conditions, including&nbsp;<a>depression</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a>bipolar disorder</a></li>\n<li>amiodarone &ndash; a medication sometimes used to treat irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias)</li>\n<li>interferons &ndash; a class of medication sometimes used to treat certain types of&nbsp;<a>cancer</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a>hepatitis C</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Treating an underactive thyroid</h2>\n<p>An underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) is usually treated by taking daily hormone replacement tablets called levothyroxine.</p>\n<p>Levothyroxine&nbsp;replaces the thyroxine hormone, which your thyroid doesn\'t make enough of.</p>\n<p>You\'ll initially have regular&nbsp;<a>blood tests</a>&nbsp;until the correct dose&nbsp;of levothyroxine is reached. This&nbsp;can take a little while to get right.</p>\n<p>You may start on a low dose of levothyroxine, which may be increased gradually, depending on how your body responds.&nbsp;Some people start to feel better&nbsp;soon after beginning treatment,&nbsp;while others&nbsp;don\'t notice an improvement in their symptoms for several months</p>\n<p>Once you\'re taking the correct dose, you\'ll usually have a blood test once a year to monitor your hormone levels.</p>\n<p>If&nbsp;blood tests suggest you may have an underactive thyroid, but you don\'t have any symptoms or they\'re very mild, you may not need any treatment. In these cases, your GP will usually monitor your hormone levels every few months and prescribe levothyroxine if you develop symptoms.</p>\n<h2>Taking levothyroxine</h2>\n<p>If you\'re prescribed levothyroxine, you should take one tablet at the same time every day.&nbsp;It\'s usually recommended that you take the tablets in the morning, although some people prefer to take them at night.</p>\n<p>The effectiveness of the&nbsp;tablets can be altered by other medications, supplements or foods, so they should be swallowed with water on an empty stomach, and you should avoid eating for 30 minutes afterwards.</p>\n<p>If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember, if this is within a few hours of your usual time. If you don\'t remember until later than this, skip the dose and take the next dose at the usual time, unless&nbsp;advised otherwise by your doctor.</p>\n<p>An underactive thyroid is a lifelong condition, so you\'ll usually need to take levothyroxine for the rest of your life.</p>\n<p>If you\'re prescribed levothyroxine because you have an underactive thyroid, you\'re entitled to a medical exemption certificate. This means you don\'t have to pay for your prescriptions.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Side effects</h3>\n<p>Levothyroxine doesn\'t usually have any side effects, because the tablets simply replace a missing hormone.</p>\n<p>Side effects usually only occur if you\'re taking too much levothyroxine. This can cause problems including&nbsp;sweating,&nbsp;<a>chest pain</a>,&nbsp;<a>headaches</a>,&nbsp;<a>diarrhoea</a>&nbsp;and vomiting.</p>\n<p>Tell your doctor if you develop new symptoms while taking levothyroxine. You should also let them know if your symptoms get worse or don\'t improve.</p>\n<h2>Combination therapy</h2>\n<p>In the UK, combination therapy &ndash; using levothyroxine and triiodothyronine (T3) together &ndash; isn\'t routinely used because there\'s insufficient evidence to show it&rsquo;s better than using levothyroxine alone (monotherapy).</p>\n<p>In most cases,&nbsp;suppressing thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) using high dose thyroid replacement therapy should be avoided because it carries a risk of causing adverse side effects, such as&nbsp;<a>atrial fibrillation</a>&nbsp;(an irregular and abnormally fast heart rate),&nbsp;<a>strokes</a>,&nbsp;<a>osteoporosis</a>&nbsp;and fracture.</p>\n<p>However, this type of treatment may sometimes be recommended in cases where a person has a history of&nbsp;<a>thyroid cancer</a>&nbsp;and there&rsquo;s a significant risk of it reoccurring.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(121,120,NULL,NULL,'<h1>Bone cancer:</h1>\n<h2>About bone cancer</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Primary bone cancer is a rare type of cancer that begins in the bones.

While it\'s highly unlikely to be the result of bone cancer, it does require further investigation.</p>\n<h2>Types of bone cancer</h2>\n<p>Some of the main types of bone cancer are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>osteosarcoma &ndash; the most common type, which mostly affects children and&nbsp;young adults under 20</li>\n<li><a>Ewing sarcoma</a>&nbsp;&ndash; which most commonly affects people aged between 10&nbsp;and 20</li>\n<li>chondrosarcoma &ndash; which tends to affect adults aged over 40</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Young people can be affected because&nbsp;the rapid growth spurts that occur during&nbsp;puberty&nbsp;may make bone tumours develop.</p>\n<p>The above&nbsp;types of bone cancer&nbsp;affect different types of&nbsp;cell. The treatment and outlook will depend on the type of bone cancer you have.</p>\n<h2>What causes bone cancer?</h2>\n<p>In most cases, it\'s not known why a person develops bone cancer.</p>\n<p>You\'re more at risk&nbsp;of developing it if you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>have had previous exposure to&nbsp;radiation&nbsp;during&nbsp;<a>radiotherapy</a></li>\n<li>have a condition known as&nbsp;<a>Paget&rsquo;s disease of the bone</a>&nbsp;&ndash; however, only a very small number of people with Paget&rsquo;s disease will actually develop bone cancer</li>\n<li>have a rare genetic condition called&nbsp;Li-Fraumeni syndrome&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;people with this condition have a faulty version of a gene that normally helps stop the growth of cancerous cells</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How bone cancer is treated</h2>\n<p>Treatment for bone cancer depends on the type of bone cancer you have and how far it has spread.</p>\n<p>Most people have a combination of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>surgery to remove the section of cancerous bone &ndash; it\'s often possible to reconstruct or replace the bone that\'s been removed,&nbsp;but&nbsp;<a>amputation</a>&nbsp;is sometimes necessary</li>\n<li><a>chemotherapy</a>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;treatment&nbsp;with powerful cancer-killing medication</li>\n<li><a>radiotherapy</a>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;where&nbsp;radiation is used to destroy cancerous cells</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In some cases of&nbsp;osteosarcoma,&nbsp;a medication called mifamurtide may also&nbsp;be recommended.</p>\n<h2>Outlook</h2>\n<p>The outlook for bone cancer depends on&nbsp;factors such as&nbsp;your age, the type of bone cancer you have, how far the cancer has spread (the stage), and how likely it is to spread further (the grade).</p>\n<p>Generally, bone cancer is much easier to cure in otherwise healthy people whose cancer hasn\'t spread.</p>\n<p>Overall, around 6 in every 10 people with bone cancer will live for at least 5 years from the time of their diagnosis, and many of these may be cured completely.</p>\n<h2>Symptoms of bone cancer</h2>\n<div class=\"editor\">\n<p>Bone pain is the most common symptom of bone cancer. Some people experience other symptoms as well.</p>\n<h2>Bone pain</h2>\n<p>Pain caused by bone cancer usually begins with a feeling of tenderness in the affected bone. This&nbsp;gradually progresses to a persistent ache or ache that comes and goes, which continues at night and when resting.</p>\n<p>Any bone can be affected, although bone cancer most often develops in the long bones of the legs or upper arms.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;pain can sometimes be&nbsp;wrongly mistaken for&nbsp;<a>arthritis</a>&nbsp;in adults and growing pains&nbsp;in children and teenagers.</p>\n<h2>Other symptoms</h2>\n<p>Some people&nbsp;also experience swelling and redness (inflammation) or&nbsp;notice a lump on or around the affected bone. If the bone is near a joint, the swelling may make it difficult to use the joint.</p>\n<p>In some cases, the cancer can weaken a bone, causing it to break (fracture) easily&nbsp;after a minor injury or&nbsp;<a>fall</a>.</p>\n<p>Less common symptoms can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above</li>\n<li>unexplained weight loss</li>\n<li>sweating, particularly&nbsp;at night</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>When to seek medical advice</h2>\n<p>See your GP if you or your child experiences persistent, severe or worsening bone pain, or if you\'re worried about any of the symptoms mentioned above.</p>\n<p>While it\'s highly unlikely that your symptoms are caused by cancer, it\'s best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis.</p>\n<h2>Causes of bone cancer</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Cancer occurs when the cells in a certain area of your body divide and multiply too rapidly. This produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour.</p>\n<p>The exact reason why this happens is often not known, but certain things can increase your chance of developing the condition, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>previous&nbsp;<a>radiotherapy</a>&nbsp;treatment</li>\n<li>other&nbsp;bone conditions, such as&nbsp;<a>Paget&rsquo;s disease of the bone</a></li>\n<li>rare genetic conditions, such as&nbsp;Li-Fraumeni syndrome</li>\n<li>a history of&nbsp;certain&nbsp;other&nbsp;conditions, including&nbsp;<a>retinoblastoma</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a>umbilical hernia</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These risk factors are described in more detail below.</p>\n<h2>Radiotherapy treatment</h2>\n<p>Previous exposure to high doses of radiation&nbsp;during&nbsp;<a>radiotherapy</a>&nbsp;may cause cancerous changes in your bone cells at a later stage, although this risk is thought to be small.</p>\n<h2>Bone conditions</h2>\n<p>Some non-cancerous (benign) conditions affecting the bones may increase your chances of developing bone cancer, although the risk is still small.</p>\n<p>In particular, a condition called Paget&rsquo;s disease of the bone&nbsp;can increase the risk of bone cancer in people over 50-60 years of age.</p>\n<p>Rarer conditions that cause tumours to grow in your bones, such as Ollier\'s disease, can also increase your risk of bone cancer.</p>\n<h2>Genetic conditions</h2>\n<p>A rare genetic condition called&nbsp;Li-Fraumeni syndrome can increase your risk of developing bone cancer, as well as several other types of cancer.</p>\n<p>People with this condition have a faulty version of a gene that usually helps stop the growth of tumours in the body.</p>\n<h2>Other conditions</h2>\n<p>People who had a rare type of eye cancer called retinoblastoma&nbsp;as a child may be more likely to develop bone cancer, because the same inherited faulty gene can be responsible for both conditions.</p>\n<p>Research has also found that babies born with an umbilical hernia&nbsp;are three times more likely to develop a type of bone cancer called Ewing sarcoma,&nbsp;although the risk is still&nbsp;very small.</p>\n<h2>Diagnosing bone cancer</h2>\n<div>\n<p>If you\'re experiencing bone pain, your GP will ask about your symptoms and examine the affected area, before deciding whether you need to have any further tests.</p>\n<p>They will look for any swelling or lumps, and ask if you have&nbsp;problems moving the affected area. They may ask about the type of pain you experience &ndash; whether it\'s constant or comes and goes, and whether anything makes it worse.</p>\n<p>After being examined, you may be&nbsp;referred for an&nbsp;<a>X-ray</a>&nbsp;of the affected area to look for any problems in the bones. If the X-ray shows abnormal areas, you\'ll be referred to&nbsp;an orthopaedic surgeon (a specialist in bone conditions) or bone cancer specialist&nbsp;for a further assessment.</p>\n<p>Some of the tests you may have to help diagnose and assess bone cancer are described below.</p>\n<h2>X-rays</h2>\n<p>An X-ray&nbsp;is a procedure where radiation is used to&nbsp;produce images of the inside of the body. It\'s a particularly effective way of looking at bones.</p>\n<p>X-rays can often detect damage to the bones caused by cancer, or new bone that\'s growing because of cancer.&nbsp;They can also determine whether your symptoms are&nbsp;caused by&nbsp;something else, such as a broken&nbsp;bone (fracture).</p>\n<p>If&nbsp;an X-ray suggests you may have bone cancer, you should be referred to a specialist centre with expertise in diagnosing and treating the condition. As bone cancer is&nbsp;rare,&nbsp;there are a&nbsp;small number of specialist centres, so you may have to travel outside your local area for advice and treatment.</p>\n<h2>Biopsy</h2>\n<p>The most definitive way of diagnosing bone cancer is to take a sample of affected bone and send it to a laboratory for testing. This is known as a&nbsp;<a>biopsy</a>.</p>\n<p>A biopsy can determine exactly what type of bone cancer you have and what grade it is (see below).</p>\n<p>A biopsy can be&nbsp;carried out&nbsp;in two ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A core needle biopsy is&nbsp;performed under anaesthetic (depending on where the bone is located, this could be a&nbsp;<a >local anaesthetic</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>general anaesthetic</a>).&nbsp;A thin needle is inserted into the bone and used to remove a sample of tissue.</li>\n<li>An open biopsy is&nbsp;performed under a general anaesthetic. The surgeon makes an incision in the affected bone to remove a sample of tissue.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may need to have an open biopsy if the results of a core needle biopsy are inconclusive.</p>\n<h2>Further tests</h2>\n<p>If the results of the biopsy confirm or suggest bone cancer, it\'s likely you\'ll have further tests to assess how far the cancer has spread. These tests are described below.</p>\n<h3>MRI scan</h3>\n<p>A&nbsp;<a>magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan</a>&nbsp;uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed pictures of the bones and soft tissues.</p>\n<p>An MRI scan is an effective way of assessing the size and spread of any cancerous tumour in or around the bones.</p>\n<h3>CT scan</h3>\n<p>A&nbsp;<a>computerised tomography (CT) scan</a>&nbsp;involves taking a series of X-rays and using a computer to reassemble them into a detailed three-dimensional (3-D) image of your body.</p>\n<p>CT scans are often used to check if the cancer has spread to your lungs. Chest X-rays may also be taken for this purpose.</p>\n<h3>Bone scans</h3>\n<p>A bone scan can&nbsp;give more detailed information about the inside of your bones than an X-ray. During a bone scan,&nbsp;a small amount of radioactive material is injected into your veins.</p>\n<p>Abnormal areas of bone will absorb the material at a faster rate than normal bone and will show up as \"hot spots\" on the scan.</p>\n<h3>Bone marrow biopsy</h3>\n<p>If you have a type of bone cancer called&nbsp;<a>Ewing sarcoma</a>, you may have a test called a bone&nbsp;marrow biopsy to check if the cancer has spread to the bone marrow (the tissue inside your bones).</p>\n<p>During the test,&nbsp;a needle is inserted into your bone to remove a sample of your bone marrow. This may be done under either local or general anaesthetic.</p>\n<h2>Staging and grading</h2>\n<p>Once these tests have been completed, it should be possible to tell you what stage and grade the bone cancer is. Staging is a description of how far a cancer has spread and grading is a description of how quickly the cancer is likely to spread in the future.</p>\n<p>A widely used staging system for bone cancer in&nbsp;the UK&nbsp;uses three main stages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stage 1 &ndash; the cancer is low-grade and has not spread beyond the bone</li>\n<li>Stage 2 &ndash; the cancer has still not spread beyond the bone, but is a high-grade</li>\n<li>Stage 3 &nbsp;&ndash; the cancer has spread into other parts of the body, such as the lungs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most cases of stage 1 bone cancer and some stage 2 bone cancers have a good&nbsp;chance of being cured. Unfortunately, stage 3 bone cancer is more difficult to cure, although treatment can relieve symptoms and slow the spread of the cancer.</p>\n<h2>Coping with a diagnosis</h2>\n<p>Being told&nbsp;you have bone cancer can be a distressing and frightening experience. Receiving that type of news can be upsetting at any age, but can be particularly difficult if you are still in your teenage years, or&nbsp;if you\'re a parent of a child who has just been told&nbsp;they have bone cancer.</p>\n<p>These types of feelings can cause considerable stress and anxiety, which in some cases can trigger&nbsp;<a>depression</a>. If you think you may be depressed,&nbsp;your GP may be a good person to talk to about support and possibly&nbsp;treatment.</p>\n<p>You may also find it useful to contact the&nbsp;<a>Bone Cancer Research Trust</a>, which is the UK&rsquo;s leading charity for people affected by bone cancer, if you need more information. If you\'re a teenager you may want to contact the&nbsp;<a>Teenage Cancer Trust</a>, which is a charity for teenagers and young adults affected by cancer.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Treating bone cancer</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Treatment for bone cancer depends on the type of bone cancer you have, how far it has spread and your general health. The main treatments are surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.</p>\n<h2>Your treatment plan</h2>\n<p>Your treatment should be managed by a specialist centre with experience in treating bone cancer, where you\'ll be cared for by a team of different healthcare professionals known as a multi-disciplinary team (MDT).</p>\n<p>Members of the MDT will include an orthopaedic surgeon (a surgeon who specialises in bone and joint surgery), a clinical oncologist (a specialist in the non-surgical treatment of cancer) and a specialist cancer nurse, among others.</p>\n<p>Your MDT will recommend what they think is the best treatment for you, but the final decision will be yours.</p>\n<p>Your recommended treatment plan may include a combination of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>surgery to remove the section of cancerous bone &ndash; it\'s often possible to reconstruct or replace the bone that\'s been removed, although&nbsp;<a>amputation</a>&nbsp;is occasionally necessary</li>\n<li><a>chemotherapy</a>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;treatment&nbsp;with powerful cancer-killing medication</li>\n<li><a>radiotherapy</a>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;where&nbsp;radiation is used to destroy cancerous cells</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In some cases, a medication called mifamurtide may be recommended as well.</p>\n<h2>Surgery</h2>\n<p>Surgery to remove the cancerous area of bone is an important part of treatment for bone cancer, although it\'s often combined with the other treatments mentioned below.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, it\'s usually possible to avoid removing an affected body part completely (known as limb-sparing surgery), although up to 1 in every 10 people may need to have a limb permanently removed (amputation).</p>\n<h3>Limb-sparing surgery</h3>\n<p>Limb-sparing surgery is usually possible when the cancer has not spread beyond the bone, and the bone can be reconstructed.</p>\n<p>The most common type of limb-sparing surgery involves removing the section of affected bone and some of the surrounding tissue (in case any cancerous cells have spread into the tissue).</p>\n<p>The removed section of bone&nbsp;may then be&nbsp;replaced with a metal implant called a prosthesis or a piece of bone from elsewhere in your body (bone graft).</p>\n<p>If the cancer is near a joint, such as the knee, it may be&nbsp;possible to remove the joint and replace it with an artificial one. Read more about&nbsp;<a>knee joint replacement</a>&nbsp;and hip joint replacement.</p>\n<h3>Amputation</h3>\n<p>Amputation&nbsp;may be necessary if limb-sparing surgery is not possible or has not worked well. For example, it may be necessary if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the cancer has spread beyond the bone into major blood vessels or nerves</li>\n<li>you developed an infection after limb-sparing surgery and the prosthesis or bone graft had to be removed&nbsp;</li>\n<li>the cancer has developed in a part of the body where limb-sparing surgery is not technically possible, such as the ankle</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your care team will understand the shock and fear that you, or your child, may be feeling if an amputation is needed and should be able to provide you with&nbsp;counselling and other support. In some cases, your care team may be able to introduce you to someone who has already had an amputation.</p>\n<p>After an amputation, most people use an artificial limb to replace the limb that\'s removed. These limbs are now very advanced and convenient to use. For example, people with an artificial leg are often able to walk, run and play sport, and have an excellent quality of life.</p>\n<h3>Recovering from surgery</h3>\n<p>After limb-sparing surgery or an amputation, you\'ll need help to return to normal life. This is known as rehabilitation.</p>\n<p>Rehabilitation will usually involve physiotherapy&nbsp;sessions, where you carry out exercises to help regain proper function in the treated body part, and&nbsp;<a>occupational therapy</a>, where you\'re taught skills to help you cope with day-to-day activities.</p>\n<p>After an amputation, you may be referred to a local limb centre for advice, support and rehabilitation treatment.&nbsp;Read more about&nbsp;<a>living with an amputation</a>.</p>\n<h2>Chemotherapy</h2>\n<p>There are four ways chemotherapy can be used to treat bone cancer. It can be used:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>before surgery, to shrink the tumour and make surgery easier</li>\n<li>in combination with radiotherapy before surgery (chemoradiation)&nbsp;&ndash; this approach works particularly well in the treatment of&nbsp;<a>Ewing sarcoma</a></li>\n<li>after surgery, to prevent the cancer returning</li>\n<li>to control symptoms in cases where a cure is not possible (known as palliative chemotherapy)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chemotherapy for bone cancer involves taking a combination of different medications that are usually delivered via a drip into your vein, or into a line inserted into a bigger blood vessel.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;treatment is&nbsp;usually given in cycles. A cycle involves taking the chemotherapy medication for several days, then having a break for a few weeks to allow your body to recover from the effects of the treatment. The number of cycles&nbsp;you&nbsp;need will depend on the type and grade of your bone cancer.</p>\n<h3>Side effects</h3>\n<p>Chemotherapy can damage healthy cells as well as cancerous cells, which means it often causes a number of side effects.</p>\n<p>Common side effects of chemotherapy include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>nausea&nbsp;and vomiting&nbsp;</li>\n<li><a>diarrhoea</a></li>\n<li><a>mouth ulcers</a>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>tiredness</li>\n<li>increased risk of catching infections</li>\n<li>temporary&nbsp;<a>infertility</a>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most side effects associated with chemotherapy should resolve once your treatment has finished. However, there is a risk&nbsp;you will be permanently infertile. Your care team will provide more detailed information about the specific risk to your fertility.</p>\n<h2>Radiotherapy</h2>\n<p>As with chemotherapy, radiotherapy can be used before and after surgery to treat bone cancer, or used to control the symptoms and slow the spread of cancer when a cure is not possible.</p>\n<p>Radiotherapy for bone cancer involves beams of radiation being directed at the cancerous section of bone by an external machine.</p>\n<p>This is normally given in daily sessions, five days a week, with each session lasting a few minutes. The whole course of treatment will usually last a few weeks.</p>\n<h3>Side effects</h3>\n<p>The radiation you\'re exposed to during radiotherapy will mostly be focused on the cancerous cells, but healthy cells nearby can also be damaged. This can lead to&nbsp;side effects such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>reddening and irritation of the skin (this can feel much like sunburn)</li>\n<li>joint pain in the part of the body that is being treated</li>\n<li>feeling sick</li>\n<li>hair loss in the body part being treated</li>\n<li>tiredness</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These side effects will pass once the radiotherapy has been completed, although feelings of tiredness may persist for several weeks.</p>\n<h2>Mifamurtide</h2>\n<p>For people with a type of bone cancer called osteosarcoma, a medication called mifamurtide may be used alongside the treatments described above.</p>\n<p>Mifamurtide is an immune macrophage stimulant. This means it works by encouraging the immune system to produce specialised cells&nbsp;that kill cancerous cells.</p>\n<p>It\'s normally recommended for young people with&nbsp;high-grade osteosarcomas and is given&nbsp;after surgery, in combination with chemotherapy, to help prevent the cancer returning.</p>\n<p>Mifamurtide is slowly pumped into one of your veins over the course of an hour (known as infusion). The recommended course of treatment is usually twice a week for 12 weeks, and then once a week for a further 24 weeks.</p>\n<h3>Side effects</h3>\n<p>Mifamurtide can cause a wide range of side effects. These can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>nausea and vomiting&nbsp;</li>\n<li>diarrhoea or&nbsp;<a >constipation</a></li>\n<li><a>headache</a>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>dizziness</li>\n<li>loss of appetite</li>\n<li>tiredness and weakness</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It\'s unclear whether it\'s safe to take mifamurtide during pregnancy, so as a precaution it\'s important&nbsp;to&nbsp;use an effective method of contraception if you\'re a sexually active woman. You will need to tell your MDT as soon as possible if you&nbsp;think you\'re&nbsp;pregnant, and you should avoid breastfeeding while taking mifamurtide.</p>\n<h2>Follow-up</h2>\n<p>Once your treatment has finished, you\'ll need to attend regular follow-up appointments to check&nbsp;the cancer hasn\'t returned.</p>\n<p>You\'ll be asked to attend frequent appointments in the first two years after treatment has finished &ndash; possibly every&nbsp;three months.&nbsp;These will&nbsp;become less frequent as the years go on.</p>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(122,121,NULL,NULL,'<h1>Bowel cancer:</h1>\n<h2>About bowel cancer</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Bowel cancer is a general term for cancer that begins in the large bowel. Depending on where the cancer starts, bowel cancer is sometimes called colon or rectal cancer.</p>\n<p>Cancer can sometimes start in the small bowel (small intestine), but small bowel cancer is much rarer than large bowel cancer.</p>\n<p>Bowel cancer is one of the most common types of cancer diagnosed in the UK, with around 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year.</p>\n<p>About&nbsp;1 in every 20 people in the UK will develop bowel cancer&nbsp;in their lifetime.</p>\n<h2>Signs and symptoms</h2>\n<p>The three main symptoms of bowel cancer are blood in the stools (faeces), changes in bowel habit&nbsp;&ndash; such as more frequent, looser stools&nbsp;&ndash; and&nbsp;<a>abdominal (tummy) pain</a>.</p>\n<p>However, these symptoms are very common and most people with them do not have bowel cancer. For example, blood in the stools is more often caused by&nbsp;<a>haemorrhoids</a>&nbsp;(piles), and a change in bowel habit or abdominal pain is usually&nbsp;the result of&nbsp;something you have eaten.</p>\n<p>As almost 9&nbsp;out of 10 people with bowel cancer are over the age of 60, these symptoms are more important as people get older. They are also more significant when they persist despite simple treatments.</p>\n<p>Most people who are eventually diagnosed with bowel cancer have one of the following combinations of&nbsp;symptoms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a persistent change in bowel habit that causes them to go to the toilet more often and pass looser stools, usually together with blood on or in their stools</li>\n<li>a persistent change in bowel habit without blood in their stools, but with abdominal pain</li>\n<li>blood in the stools without other haemorrhoid symptoms, such as soreness, discomfort, pain, itching or a lump hanging down outside the back passage</li>\n<li>abdominal pain, discomfort or bloating always provoked by eating, sometimes resulting in a reduction in the amount of food eaten and weight loss</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The symptoms of bowel cancer can be subtle and don\'t necessarily make you feel ill.</p>\n<h2>When to seek medical advice</h2>\n<p>Read about the&nbsp;<a>symptoms of&nbsp;bowel cancer</a>, and when you should see your GP to discuss whether any tests are necessary.</p>\n<p>Your doctor will probably carry out a simple examination of your tummy and bottom to make sure you have no lumps.</p>\n<p>They may also&nbsp;arrange for a simple blood test to check for&nbsp;iron deficiency anaemia&nbsp;&ndash; this can indicate whether there is any bleeding from your bowel that you haven\'t been aware of.</p>\n<p>In some cases, your doctor may decide it is best for you to have a simple test in hospital to make sure there is no serious cause for your symptoms.</p>\n<p>Make sure you return to your doctor if your symptoms persist or keep coming back after stopping treatment, regardless of their severity or your age.</p>\n<h2>Who\'s at risk?</h2>\n<p>It\'s not known exactly what causes bowel cancer, but there are a number of things that can increase your risk. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>age &ndash; almost&nbsp;9 in 10 cases of bowel cancer occur in people aged 60 or over</li>\n<li>diet &ndash; a diet high in red or processed meats and low in fibre can increase your risk</li>\n<li>weight &ndash; bowel cancer is more common in people who are overweight or obese</li>\n<li>exercise &ndash; being inactive increases the risk of getting bowel cancer</li>\n<li>alcohol and smoking &ndash; a high alcohol intake and smoking may increase your chances of getting bowel cancer</li>\n<li>family history &ndash; having a close relative (mother or father, brother or sister) who developed bowel cancer&nbsp;under the age of&nbsp;50 puts you at a greater lifetime risk of developing the condition</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some people have an increased risk of bowel cancer because they have another condition that affects their bowel, such as severe&nbsp;<a>ulcerative colitis</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>Crohn\'s disease</a>, over a long period of time.</p>\n<h2>Bowel cancer screening</h2>\n<p>Bowel screening is offered to men and women aged 50 to 74 across Scotland to help find bowel cancer early when it can often be cured.</p>\n<p>Bowel screening involves taking a&nbsp;<a>simple test</a>&nbsp;at home every 2 years. The test looks for hidden blood in your poo, as this could mean a higher chance of bowel cancer.</p>\n<h2>Treatment and outlook</h2>\n<p>Bowel cancer can be treated using a combination of different treatments, depending on where the cancer is in your bowel and how far it has spread.</p>\n<p>The main treatments are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>surgery &ndash;&nbsp;the cancerous section of bowel is removed; it is the most effective way of curing bowel cancer, and is all that many people need</li>\n<li><a>chemotherapy</a>&nbsp;&ndash; where medication is used to kill cancer cells&nbsp;</li>\n<li><a>radiotherapy</a>&nbsp;&ndash; where radiation is used to kill cancer cells</li>\n<li>biological treatments &ndash; a newer type of medication that increases the effectiveness of chemotherapy and prevents the cancer spreading</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As with most types of cancer, the chances of a complete cure depends on how far&nbsp;it&nbsp;has advanced by the time it is diagnosed. If the cancer is confined to the bowel, surgery will usually be able to completely remove it.</p>\n<p>Overall, 7 to 8 in every 10 people with bowel cancer will live at least one year after diagnosis. More than half of those diagnosed will live at least another 10 years. Every year, around 16,000 people die as a result of bowel cancer.</p>\n<h2>Signs and symptoms of bowel cancer</h2>\n<div>\n<p>The three main symptoms of bowel cancer are blood in the stools (faeces), a change in bowel habit, such as more frequent, looser stools, and&nbsp;<a>abdominal (tummy) pain</a>.</p>\n<p>However, these symptoms are very common. Blood in the stools is usually caused by&nbsp;<a>haemorrhoids</a>&nbsp;(piles), and a change in bowel habit or abdominal pain is often the result of&nbsp;something you have eaten.</p>\n<p>In the UK, an estimated 7 million people have blood in the stools each year. Even more people have temporary changes in their bowel habits and abdominal pain. Most people with these symptoms do not have bowel cancer.</p>\n<p>As the vast majority of people with bowel cancer are over the age of 60, these symptoms are more important as people get older.&nbsp;These symptoms&nbsp;are also more significant when they persist in spite of simple treatments.</p>\n<p>Most patients with bowel cancer present with one of the following symptom combinations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a persistent change in bowel habit, causing them to go to the toilet more often and pass looser stools, usually together with blood on or in their stools</li>\n<li>a persistent change in bowel habit without blood in their stools, but with abdominal pain</li>\n<li>blood in the stools without other haemorrhoid symptoms, such as soreness, discomfort, pain, itching, or a lump hanging down outside the back passage</li>\n<li>abdominal pain, discomfort or bloating always provoked by eating, sometimes resulting in a reduction in the amount of food eaten and weight loss</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The symptoms of bowel cancer can be subtle and don\'t necessarily make you feel ill.</p>\n<h2>When to seek medical advice</h2>\n<p>Read about the&nbsp;<a>symptoms of&nbsp;bowel cancer</a>, and when you should see your GP to discuss whether any tests are necessary.</p>\n<p>Your doctor will probably perform a simple examination of your tummy and bottom to make sure you have no lumps, as well as&nbsp;a simple blood test to check for&nbsp;<a>iron deficiency anaemia</a>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;this can indicate whether there is any bleeding from your bowel you haven\'t been aware of.</p>\n<p>In some cases, your doctor may decide it is best to have a simple test in hospital to make sure there is no serious cause for your symptoms.</p>\n<p>Make sure you return to your doctor if your symptoms persist or keep coming back after stopping treatment, regardless of their severity or your age.</p>\n<h2>Bowel obstruction</h2>\n<p>In some cases, bowel cancer can stop digestive waste passing through the bowel. This is known as a bowel obstruction.</p>\n<p>Symptoms of a bowel obstruction can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>severe abdominal pain, which may initially come and go</li>\n<li>not being able to pass stools when you go to the toilet</li>\n<li>noticeable swelling or bloating of the tummy</li>\n<li>vomiting</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A bowel obstruction is a medical emergency. If you suspect your bowel is obstructed, you should see your GP quickly. If this isn\'t possible, go to the accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department of your nearest hospital.</p>\n<h2>Causes of bowel cancer</h2>\n<div class=\"editor\">\n<p>Cancer occurs when the cells in a certain area of your body divide and multiply too rapidly. This produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour.</p>\n<p>Most cases of bowel cancer first develop inside clumps of cells on the inner lining of the bowel. These clumps are known as&nbsp;<a>polyps</a>. However, if you develop polyps, it does not necessarily mean you will get bowel cancer.</p>\n<p>Exactly what causes cancer to develop inside the bowel is still unknown. However, research has shown several factors may make you more likely to develop it. These factors are outlined below.</p>\n<h2>Age</h2>\n<p>Your chances of developing bowel cancer increase as you get older. Almost&nbsp;9 out of 10 cases of bowel cancer in the UK are diagnosed in people over the age of 60.</p>\n<h2>Family history</h2>\n<p>Having a family history of bowel cancer can increase your risk of developing the condition yourself, particularly if a close relative (mother, father, brother or sister) was diagnosed with bowel cancer below the age of 50.</p>\n<p>If you are particularly concerned that your family\'s medical history may mean you are at an increased risk of developing bowel cancer, it may help to speak to your GP.</p>\n<p>If necessary, your GP can refer you to a genetics specialist, who can offer more advice about your level of risk and recommend any necessary tests to periodically check for the condition.</p>\n<h2>Diet</h2>\n<p>A large body of evidence suggests a diet high in red and processed meat can increase your risk of developing bowel cancer.</p>\n<p>For this reason, the Department of Health advises people who eat more than 90g (cooked weight) a day of red and processed meat cut down to 70g a day.</p>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;<a>red meat and bowel cancer risk</a></p>\n<p>There is also evidence that&nbsp;suggests a diet high in fibre could help reduce your bowel cancer risk.</p>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;<a>eating good food and a healthy diet</a></p>\n<h2>Smoking</h2>\n<p>People who smoke cigarettes are more likely to develop bowel cancer, other types of cancer, and other serious conditions, such as&nbsp;<a>heart disease</a>.</p>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;<a>stopping smoking</a></p>\n<h2>Alcohol</h2>\n<p>Drinking alcohol has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of bowel cancer, particularly if you regularly drink large amounts.</p>\n<p>Read about&nbsp;<a>drinking and alcohol</a>&nbsp;for information and tips on cutting down</p>\n<h2>Obesity</h2>\n<p>Being overweight or&nbsp;<a>obese</a>&nbsp;is linked to an increased risk of bowel cancer, particularly in men.</p>\n<p>If you are overweight or obese,&nbsp;<a>losing weight</a>&nbsp;may help lower your chances of developing the condition.</p>\n<h2>Inactivity</h2>\n<p>People who are physically inactive have a higher risk of developing bowel cancer.</p>\n<p>You can help reduce your risk of bowel and other cancers by being physically active every day.</p>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;<a>health and fitness</a></p>\n<h2>Digestive disorders</h2>\n<p>Some conditions affecting the bowel may put you at a higher risk of developing bowel cancer. For example, bowel cancer is more common in people who have had severe&nbsp;<a>Crohn\'s disease</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>ulcerative colitis</a>&nbsp;for many years.</p>\n<p>If you have one of these conditions, you will usually have regular check-ups to look for signs of bowel cancer from about 10 years after your symptoms first develop.</p>\n<p>Check-ups will involve examining your bowel with a colonoscope&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;a long, narrow flexible tube&nbsp;that contains&nbsp;a small camera&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;that is inserted into your rectum.</p>\n<p>The frequency of the colonoscopy examinations will increase the longer you live with the condition, and will also depend on factors such as how severe your ulcerative colitis is and if you have a family history of bowel cancer.</p>\n<h2>Genetic conditions</h2>\n<p>There are two rare inherited conditions that can lead to bowel cancer. They are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) &ndash; a condition that triggers the growth of non-cancerous polyps inside the bowel</li>\n<li>hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome &ndash; an inherited gene fault (mutation) that increases your bowel cancer risk</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although the polyps caused by FAP are non-cancerous, there is a high risk that, over time, at least one will turn cancerous. Most people with FAP will have bowel cancer by the time they are 50.</p>\n<p>As people with FAP have such a high risk of getting bowel cancer, they are often advised by their doctor to have their large bowel removed before they reach the age of 25.</p>\n<h2>Treating bowel cancer</h2>\n<div >\n<p>If&nbsp;colon cancer is at a very early stage, it may be possible to remove just a small piece of the lining of the colon wall. This is known as local excision.</p>\n<p>If the cancer spreads into&nbsp;muscles surrounding the colon, it will usually be necessary to remove an entire section of your colon.&nbsp;This is known as a colectomy.</p>\n<p>There are two ways a colectomy can be performed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>an open colectomy &ndash; where the surgeon makes a large cut (incision) in your abdomen and removes a section of your colon</li>\n<li>a laparoscopic (keyhole) colectomy &ndash; where the surgeon makes a number of small incisions in your abdomen and uses special instruments guided by a camera to remove a section of colon</li>\n</ul>\n<p>During surgery, nearby lymph nodes are also removed. It is usual to join the ends of the bowel together after bowel cancer surgery, but very occasionally this is not possible and a stoma is needed.</p>\n<p>Both open and laparoscopic colectomies are thought to be equally effective at removing cancer and have similar risks of complications.</p>\n<p>However, laparoscopic colectomies have the advantage of a faster recovery time and less postoperative pain. It is becoming the routine way of doing most of these operations.</p>\n<p>Laparoscopic colectomies should be available in all hospitals that carry out bowel cancer surgery, although not all surgeons perform this type of surgery. Discuss your options with your surgeon to see if this method can be used.</p>\n<h2>Surgery for rectal cancer</h2>\n<p>There are a number of different types of operation that can be carried out to treat rectal cancer, depending on how far the cancer has spread.</p>\n<p>Some of the main techniques used are described below:</p>\n<h3>Local resection</h3>\n<p>If you have a very small, early-stage rectal cancer, your surgeon may be able to remove it in an operation called a local resection (transanal resection).</p>\n<p>The surgeon puts an endoscope in through your back passage and removes the cancer from the wall of the rectum.</p>\n<h3>Total mesenteric excision</h3>\n<p>In many cases, however, a local resection is not possible. Instead, a larger area of the rectum will need to be removed.</p>\n<p>This area will&nbsp;include a border of rectal tissue free of cancer cells, as well as fatty tissue&nbsp;from around the bowel&nbsp;(the mesentery). This type of operation is known as total mesenteric excision (TME).</p>\n<p>Removing the mesentery can help ensure all the cancerous cells are removed, which can lower the risk of the cancer recurring at a later stage.</p>\n<p>Depending on where in your rectum the cancer is located, one of two main TME operations may be carried out. These are outlined below.</p>\n<h3>Low anterior resection</h3>\n<p>Low anterior resection is a procedure used to treat cases where the cancer is in the upper section of your rectum.</p>\n<p>The surgeon will make an incision in your abdomen and remove the upper section of your rectum, as well as some surrounding tissue to make sure any lymph glands containing cancer cells are also removed.</p>\n<p>They will then attach your colon to the lowest part of your rectum or upper part of the anal canal. Sometimes they turn the end of the colon into an internal pouch to replace the rectum.</p>\n<p>You will probably require a temporary stoma&nbsp;to give the joined section of bowel time to heal.</p>\n<h3>Abdominoperineal resection</h3>\n<p>Abdominoperineal resection is used to treat cases where the cancer is in the lowest section of your rectum.</p>\n<p>In this case, it will be necessary to remove the whole of your rectum and surrounding muscles to reduce the risk of the cancer regrowing in the same area.</p>\n<p>This involves removing and closing the anus and removing its sphincter muscles, so there is no option except to have a permanent stoma after the operation.</p>\n<p>Bowel cancer surgeons always do their best to avoid giving people permanent stomas wherever possible.</p>\n<h2>Stoma surgery</h2>\n<p>Where a section of the bowel is removed and the remaining bowel joined, the surgeon may sometimes decide to divert your stool away from the join to allow it to heal.</p>\n<p>The stool is temporarily diverted by bringing a loop of bowel out through the abdominal wall and attaching it to the skin &ndash; this is called a stoma. A bag is worn over the stoma to collect the stool.</p>\n<p>When the stoma is made from the small bowel (ileum) it is called an&nbsp;<a>ileostomy</a>, and when it is made from the&nbsp;large bowel (colon) it is called a&nbsp;<a>colostomy</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A specialist nurse, known as a stoma care nurse, can advise you on the best site for a stoma&nbsp;prior to surgery.</p>\n<p>The nurse will take into account factors such as your body shape and lifestyle, although this may not be possible where surgery is performed in an emergency.</p>\n<p>In&nbsp;the first few days&nbsp;after surgery, the stoma care nurse will advise on the care necessary to look after the stoma and the type of bag suitable.</p>\n<p>Once the join in the bowel has safely healed, which can take several weeks, the stoma can be closed&nbsp;during further surgery.</p>\n<p>In some people, for various reasons, rejoining the bowel may not be possible or may lead to problems controlling bowel function, and the stoma may become permanent.</p>\n<p>Before having surgery, the care team will advise you about whether it may be necessary to form an ileostomy or colostomy, and the likelihood of this being temporary or permanent.</p>\n<p>There are patient support groups available that provide support for patients who have just had or are about to have a stoma. You can&nbsp;get more&nbsp;details from&nbsp;your stoma care nurse, or visit the groups&nbsp;online for further information.</p>\n<p>These&nbsp;include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a>Ileostomy and Internal Pouch Support Group</a>&nbsp;&ndash; this organisation provides a unique visiting service for anyone wishing to speak with someone who has been through similar surgery</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Learn more about&nbsp;<a>coping with a stoma after bowel cancer</a></p>\n<h2>Side effects of surgery</h2>\n<p>Bowel cancer operations carry many of the same risks as other major operations, including bleeding, infection, developing blood clots, or heart or breathing problems.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The operations all carry a number of risks specific to the procedure. One risk is that the joined-up section of bowel may not heal properly and leak inside your abdomen. This is usually only a risk in the first few days after the operation.</p>\n<p>Another risk is for people having rectal cancer surgery. The nerves that control urination&nbsp;and sexual function are very close to the rectum, and sometimes&nbsp;surgery to remove rectal cancer can damage these nerves.</p>\n<p>After rectal cancer surgery, most people need to go to the toilet to open their bowels more often than before, although&nbsp;this usually settles down within a few months of the operation.</p>\n<h2>Radiotherapy</h2>\n<p>There are two main ways radiotherapy can be used to treat bowel cancer. It can be given before surgery to shrink rectal cancers and increase the chances of complete removal, or be used to control symptoms and slow the spread of cancer in advanced cases (palliative radiotherapy).</p>\n<p>Radiotherapy given before surgery for rectal cancer can be performed in two ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a>external radiotherapy</a>&nbsp;&ndash; where a machine is used to beam high-energy waves at your rectum to kill cancerous cells</li>\n<li><a>internal radiotherapy</a>&nbsp;(brachytherapy) &ndash; where a radioactive tube is inserted into your anus and placed next to the cancer to shrink it</li>\n</ul>\n<p>External radiotherapy is usually given daily, five days a week, with a break at the weekend. Depending on the size of your tumour, you may need one to five weeks of treatment. Each session of radiotherapy is short and will only last for 10 to 15 minutes.</p>\n<p>Internal radiotherapy can usually be performed in one session before surgery is carried out a few weeks later.</p>\n<p>Palliative radiotherapy is usually given in short daily sessions, with a course ranging from 2 to 3 days, up to 10 days.</p>\n<p>Short-term side effects of radiotherapy can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>feeling sick</li>\n<li>fatigue</li>\n<li><a>diarrhoea</a></li>\n<li>burning and irritation of the skin around the rectum and pelvis&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;this looks and feels like sunburn</li>\n<li>a frequent need to urinate</li>\n<li>a burning sensation when passing urine</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These side effects should pass once the course of radiotherapy has finished. Tell your care team if the side effects of treatment become particularly troublesome. Additional treatments are often available to help you cope with the side effects&nbsp;better.</p>\n<p>Long-term side effects of radiotherapy can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a more frequent need to pass urine or stools</li>\n<li>blood in your urine and stools</li>\n<li><a>infertility</a></li>\n<li><a>erectile dysfunction</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want to have children, it may be possible to store a sample of your sperm or eggs before treatment begins so they can be used in fertility treatments in the future.</p>\n<h2>Chemotherapy</h2>\n<p>There are three ways&nbsp;<a>chemotherapy</a>&nbsp;can be used to treat bowel cancer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>before surgery&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;used in combination with radiotherapy&nbsp;to shrink the tumour</li>\n<li>after surgery&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;to reduce the risk of the cancer recurring</li>\n<li>palliative chemotherapy&nbsp;&ndash; to slow the spread of advanced bowel cancer and help control symptoms</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chemotherapy for bowel cancer usually involves taking a combination of medications that kill cancer cells. They can be given as a tablet (oral chemotherapy), through a drip in your arm (intravenous chemotherapy), or as a combination of both.</p>\n<p>Treatment is given in courses (cycles) that are&nbsp;two to three weeks long each, depending on the stage or grade of your cancer.</p>\n<p>A single session of intravenous chemotherapy can last from several hours to several days.</p>\n<p>Most people having oral chemotherapy take tablets over the course of two weeks before having a break from treatment for another week.</p>\n<p>A course of chemotherapy can last up to six months, depending on how well you respond to the treatment. In some cases, it can be given in smaller doses over longer periods of time (maintenance chemotherapy).</p>\n<p>Side effects of chemotherapy can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>fatigue</li>\n<li>feeling sick</li>\n<li>vomiting</li>\n<li>diarrhoea</li>\n<li><a>mouth ulcers</a></li>\n<li><a>hair loss</a>&nbsp;with certain treatment regimens, but this is generally uncommon in the treatment of bowel cancer</li>\n<li>a sensation of numbness, tingling or burning in your hands, feet and neck</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These side effects should gradually pass once your treatment has finished. It usually takes a few months for your hair to grow back if you experience hair loss.</p>\n<p>Chemotherapy can also weaken your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection.</p>\n<p>Inform your care team or GP as soon as possible if you experience possible signs of an infection, including high temperature (fever) or a sudden feeling of being generally unwell.</p>\n<p>Medications used in chemotherapy can cause temporary damage to men\'s sperm and women\'s eggs. This means that for women who become pregnant or for men who father a child, there is a risk to the unborn baby\'s health.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It&nbsp;is therefore&nbsp;recommended you use a reliable method of contraception while having chemotherapy treatment and for a period after your treatment has finished.</p>\n<p>Find out more about&nbsp;<a>chemotherapy</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Biological treatments</h2>\n<p>Biological treatments, including cetuximab, bevacizumab and panitumumab, are a newer type of medication also known as monoclonal antibodies.</p>\n<p>Monoclonal antibodies are antibodies that have been genetically engineered in a laboratory. They target special proteins found on the surface of cancer cells, known as epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR).</p>\n<p>As EGFRs help the cancer grow, targeting these proteins can help shrink tumours, and improve the effect and outcome of chemotherapy.</p>\n<p>Biological treatments are therefore usually used in combination with chemotherapy when the cancer has spread beyond the bowel (metastatic bowel cancer).</p>\n<p>These treatments are not available to everyone with bowel cancer. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has specific criteria&nbsp;that need to be met before these can be prescribed.</p>\n<p>Cetuximab is only available on the NHS when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>surgery to remove the cancer in the colon or rectum has been carried out or is possible</li>\n<li>bowel cancer has spread to the liver and cannot be removed surgically</li>\n<li>a person is fit enough to undergo surgery to remove the cancer from the liver if this becomes possible after treatment with cetuximab</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cetuximab, bevacizumab and panitumumab are available on the NHS through a government scheme called the&nbsp;Cancer Drugs Fund.

It can either be cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign).</p>\n<p>Brain tumours are graded from 1 to 4 according to their behaviour, such as how fast they grow and how likely they are to&nbsp;grow back after treatment.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a>Benign brain tumours</a>&nbsp;are&nbsp;low grade (grade 1 or 2), which means they grow slowly&nbsp;and are less likely to return after treatment.</li>\n<li><a>Malignant brain tumours</a>&nbsp;are&nbsp;high grade (grade 3 or 4) and either start in the brain (primary tumours) or spread into the brain from elsewhere (secondary tumours); they\'re more likely to grow back after treatment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This page gives general information relevant to both types of brain tumour. The links above will take you to more information about the specific types.</p>\n<h3>Symptoms of a brain tumour</h3>\n<p>The symptoms of a brain tumour vary depending on the exact part of the brain that\'s affected. Common symptoms include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>severe, persistent&nbsp;<a>headaches</a></li>\n<li>seizures (fits)</li>\n<li>persistent nausea, vomiting and drowsiness</li>\n<li>mental or behavioural changes, such as memory problems or changes in personality</li>\n<li>progressive weakness or&nbsp;paralysis on one side of the body, vision problems, or speech problems</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sometimes, you may not have any symptoms to begin with, or they may only develop very slowly over time.</p>\n<h2>When to see your GP</h2>\n<p>See your GP if you&nbsp;have persistent symptoms of a brain tumour. While it\'s unlikely to be a tumour, it\'s best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis.</p>\n<p>If your GP is unable to identify a more likely cause of your symptoms, they may refer you to a neurologist for further assessment and tests, such as a brain scan.</p>\n<h2>Who is affected</h2>\n<p>Brain tumours can affect people of any age, including children, although they tend to be more common in older adults.</p>\n<p>More than 9,000 people are diagnosed with primary&nbsp;brain tumours in the UK each year, of&nbsp;which about half&nbsp;are benign and half are malignant. Many others&nbsp;are diagnosed&nbsp;with secondary brain tumours.</p>\n<p>The exact reason why some people develop primary brain tumours is unknown,&nbsp;but it\'s thought that certain genetic conditions &ndash; such as&nbsp;<a>tuberous sclerosis</a>&nbsp;&ndash; and previous&nbsp;<a>radiotherapy</a>&nbsp;to the head increase&nbsp;your risk.</p>\n<h2>Treatment and outlook</h2>\n<p>The main treatment for most brain tumours is surgery, which aims to remove as much of the abnormal tissue as possible.</p>\n<p>It\'s not always possible to remove the entire tumour, so further treatment with radiotherapy and/or&nbsp;<a >chemotherapy</a>&nbsp;may be necessary to kill any abnormal cells left behind.</p>\n<p>For most benign tumours, treatment is often&nbsp;successful and a full recovery is possible, although there\'s sometimes a small chance the tumour could come back.&nbsp;Regular follow-up appointments will normally be recommended to monitor this.</p>\n<p>The outlook for malignant tumours is generally less good, although this varies depending on things such as&nbsp;where the tumour is in the brain, your age, and your general health. Unfortunately,&nbsp;a cure is often not possible and most tumours will return after treatment.</p>\n<p>If a tumour does come back, treatment&nbsp;will aim to relieve your symptoms and prolong life by controlling the growth of the tumour.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Support and further information</h3>\n<p>As well as reading the separate pages on&nbsp;benign brain tumours&nbsp;and malignant brain tumours, you may find the following websites useful sources of information and support:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a>The Brain Tumour Charity</a></li>\n<li><a>Brain Tumour Research</a></li>\n<li><a>Cancer Research UK: brain tumours</a>&nbsp;</li>\n<li><a>Macmillan: brain tumours</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(124,123,NULL,NULL,'<h1>Breast cancer (female):</h1>\n<h2>The breasts</h2>\n<p>The breasts are made up of fat, connective tissue and thousands of tiny glands called lobules, which produce milk. When a woman has a baby, the milk is delivered to the nipple through tiny tubes called ducts, which allow her to breastfeed.</p>\n<p>The body is made up of billions of tiny cells, which usually grow and multiply in an orderly way. New cells are only produced when and where they\'re needed. In cancer, this orderly process goes wrong and cells begin to grow and multiply uncontrollably.</p>\n<h2>Symptoms of breast cancer</h2>\n<p>Breast cancer can have a number of symptoms, but the first noticeable symptom is usually a lump or area of thickened breast tissue.</p>\n<p>Most breast lumps aren\'t cancerous, but it\'s always best to have them checked by your doctor. You should also see your GP if you notice any of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a change in the size or shape of one or both breasts</li>\n<li>discharge from either of your nipples&nbsp;(which may be streaked with blood)</li>\n<li>a lump or swelling in either of your armpits</li>\n<li>dimpling on the skin of your breasts</li>\n<li>a rash on or around your nipple</li>\n<li>a change in the appearance of your nipple, such as becoming sunken into your breast</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Breast pain alone isn\'t a symptom of breast cancer.</p>\n<h2>Types of breast cancer</h2>\n<p>There are several different types of breast cancer, which can develop in different parts of the breast. Breast cancer is often divided into non-invasive and invasive types.</p>\n<h3>Non-invasive breast cancer</h3>\n<p>Non-invasive breast cancer is also known as cancer or carcinoma in situ. This cancer is found in the ducts of the breast and hasn\'t developed the ability to spread outside the breast.</p>\n<p>This form of cancer rarely shows as a lump in the breast that can be felt, and is usually found on a mammogram. The most common type of non-invasive cancer is ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).</p>\n<h3>Invasive breast cancer</h3>\n<p>Invasive cancer has the ability to spread outside the breast, although this doesn\'t necessarily mean it has spread.</p>\n<p>The most common form of breast cancer is invasive ductal breast cancer, which develops in the cells that line the breast ducts. Invasive ductal breast cancer accounts for about 80% of all&nbsp;breast cancer cases and is sometimes called \"no special type\".</p>\n<h3>Other types of breast cancer</h3>\n<p>Other less common types of breast cancer include invasive lobular breast cancer, which develops in the cells that line the milk-producing lobules, inflammatory breast cancer and&nbsp;<a>Paget\'s disease of the breast</a>.</p>\n<p>It\'s possible for breast cancer to spread to other parts of the body, usually through the lymph nodes (small glands that filter bacteria from the body) or the bloodstream. If this happens, it\'s known as \"secondary\" or \"metastatic\" breast cancer.</p>\n<h2>Breast cancer screening</h2>\n<p>About&nbsp;one in eight&nbsp;women are diagnosed with&nbsp;breast cancer during their lifetime. There\'s a good chance of recovery if it\'s detected in its early stages. For this reason, it\'s vital that women check their breasts regularly for any changes and always get any changes examined by their GP.</p>\n<p>Mammographic screening (where&nbsp;<a>X-ray</a>&nbsp;images of the breast are taken) is the best available method of detecting an early breast lesion. However, you should be aware that a mammogram might fail to detect some breast cancers. It might also increase your chances of having extra tests and interventions, including surgery.</p>\n<p>Women with a higher-than-average risk of developing breast cancer may be offered screening and genetic testing for the condition.</p>\n<p>As the risk of breast cancer increases with age, all women who are 50-70 years old are invited for breast cancer screening every three years.</p>\n<p>Women over 70 are also entitled to screening and can arrange an appointment through their GP or local screening unit.</p>\n<p>The NHS is in the process of extending the programme as a trial, offering screening to some women aged 47-73.</p>\n<h2>Treating breast cancer</h2>\n<p>If cancer is detected at an early stage, it can be treated before it spreads to nearby parts of the body.</p>\n<p>Breast cancer is treated using a combination of surgery,&nbsp;<a>chemotherapy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a>radiotherapy</a>. Surgery is usually the first type of treatment you\'ll have, followed by chemotherapy or radiotherapy or, in some cases, hormone or biological treatments.</p>\n<p>The type of surgery and the treatment you have afterwards will depend on the type of breast cancer you have. Your doctor will discuss the best treatment plan with you.</p>\n<p>In a&nbsp;small proportion of women, breast cancer is discovered after it\'s spread to other parts of the body (metastasis). Secondary cancer, also called advanced or metastatic cancer, isn\'t curable, so the aim of treatment is&nbsp;to achieve remission (symptom relief).</p>\n<h2>Preventing breast cancer</h2>\n<p>As the causes of breast cancer aren\'t fully understood, it\'s not possible to know if it can be prevented altogether.</p>\n<p>If you\'re at increased risk of developing the condition, some treatments are available to reduce the risk.</p>\n<p>Studies have looked at the link between breast cancer and diet and, although there are no definite conclusions, there are benefits for women who maintain a&nbsp;<a>healthy weight</a>,&nbsp;<a >exercise regularly</a>&nbsp;and who have a low intake of saturated&nbsp;<a>fat</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a>alcohol</a>.</p>\n<p>It\'s been suggested that regular exercise can reduce your risk of breast cancer by as much as a third. If you\'ve been through the menopause, it\'s particularly important that you\'re not overweight or obese. This is because being overweight or obese causes more oestrogen to be produced, which can increase the risk of breast cancer.</p>\n<h2>Living with breast cancer</h2>\n<p>Being diagnosed with breast cancer can affect daily life in many ways,&nbsp;depending on what stage&nbsp;it\'s at and what treatment you\'re having.</p>\n<p>How women cope with their diagnosis and treatment varies from person to person. You can be reassured that there are several forms of support available, if you need it. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>your&nbsp;family and&nbsp;friends can be a powerful support system</li>\n<li>you can communicate with other people in the same situation</li>\n<li>find out as much as possible about your condition</li>\n<li>don\'t try to do too much or overexert yourself</li>\n<li>make time for yourself</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Symptoms of breast cancer</h2>\n<div>\n<p>The first symptom of breast cancer most women notice is a lump or an area of thickened tissue in their breast.</p>\n<p>Most&nbsp;breast lumps (90%) aren\'t cancerous, but it\'s always best to have them checked by your doctor.</p>\n<p>You should see your GP if you notice any of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a lump or area of thickened tissue in either breast</li>\n<li>a change in the size or shape of one or both breasts</li>\n<li>discharge from either of your nipples&nbsp;(which may be streaked with blood)</li>\n<li>a lump or swelling in either of your armpits</li>\n<li>dimpling on the skin of your breasts</li>\n<li>a rash on or around your nipple</li>\n<li>a change in the appearance of your nipple, such as becoming sunken into your breast</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Breast pain alone isn\'t a symptom of breast cancer.</p>\n<p>Want to know more?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Breast Cancer Now:&nbsp;<a>Changes to look and feel for</a></li>\n<li>Cancer Research UK:&nbsp;<a>Breast cancer symptoms</a></li>\n<li>Macmillan:&nbsp;<a>What are the symptoms of breast cancer in women?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Breast awareness</h2>\n<p>It\'s important to be&nbsp;<a>breast aware</a>,&nbsp;so you can pick up any changes as soon as possible. Get to know what is normal for you. For instance, your breasts may look or feel different at different times of your life. This will make it much easier to spot&nbsp;potential problems.</p>\n<h2>Causes and risk factors of breast cancer</h2>\n<div>\n<p>The causes of breast cancer aren\'t fully understood, making it difficult to say why one woman may develop breast cancer and another may not.</p>\n<p>However, there are risk factors that are&nbsp;known to affect your likelihood of developing breast cancer. Some of these you can\'t do anything about, but there are some you can change.</p>\n<h2>Age</h2>\n<p>The risk of developing breast cancer increases with age. The condition is most common among women over 50 who have been through the&nbsp;<a>menopause</a>. About 8 out of 10 cases of breast cancer occur in women over 50.</p>\n<p>All women who are 50-70 years of age should be screened for breast cancer every three years as part of the NHS Breast Screening Programme. Women over the age of 70 are still eligible to be screened and can arrange this through their GP or local screening unit.</p>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;<a>breast screening</a></p>\n<h2>Family history</h2>\n<p>If you have close relatives who have had breast cancer or&nbsp;<a>ovarian cancer</a>, you may have a higher risk of developing breast cancer. However, because breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, it\'s possible for it to occur in more than one family member by chance.</p>\n<p>Most cases of breast cancer aren\'t hereditary (they don\'t run in families), but particular genes, known as BRCA1 and BRCA2, can increase your risk of developing both breast and ovarian cancer. It\'s possible for these genes to be passed on from a parent to their child. A third gene (TP53) is also associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.</p>\n<p>If you have, for example, two or more close relatives from the same side of your family, such as your mother, sister or daughter, who have had breast cancer under the age of 50, you may be eligible for surveillance for breast cancer or for genetic screening to look for the genes that make developing breast cancer more likely. If you\'re worried about your family history of breast cancer, discuss it with your GP.</p>\n<h2>Previous diagnosis of breast cancer</h2>\n<p>If you\'ve previously had breast cancer or early non-invasive cancer cell changes in breast ducts, you have a higher risk of developing it again, either in your other breast or in the same breast again.</p>\n<h2>Previous benign breast lump</h2>\n<p>A&nbsp;<a>benign breast lump</a>&nbsp;doesn\'t mean&nbsp;you have breast cancer, but certain types of lump may slightly increase your risk of developing it. Certain benign changes in your breast tissue, such as atypical ductal hyperplasia (cells growing abnormally in ducts), or lobular carcinoma in situ (abnormal cells inside your breast lobes), can make getting breast cancer more likely.</p>\n<h2>Breast density</h2>\n<p>Your breasts are made up of thousands of tiny glands (lobules), which produce milk. This glandular tissue contains a higher concentration of breast cells than other breast tissue, making it denser. Women with dense breast tissue may have a higher risk of developing breast cancer because there are more cells that can become cancerous.</p>\n<p>Dense breast tissue can also make a breast scan (mammogram) difficult to read, because it makes any lumps or areas of abnormal tissue harder to spot. Younger women tend to have denser breasts. As you get older, the amount of glandular tissue in your breasts decreases and is replaced by fat, so your breasts become less dense.</p>\n<h2>Exposure to oestrogen</h2>\n<p>The female hormone, oestrogen,&nbsp;can sometimes stimulate breast cancer cells and cause them to&nbsp;grow. The ovaries, where your eggs are stored, begin to produce oestrogen when you start&nbsp;<a>puberty</a>, to regulate your periods.</p>\n<p>Your risk of developing breast cancer may rise slightly with the amount of oestrogen&nbsp;your body is exposed to. For example, if you started your&nbsp;<a>periods</a>&nbsp;at a young age and experienced the&nbsp;menopause at a late age, you\'ll have been exposed to oestrogen over a longer period of time. In the same way, not having children, or having children later in life, may slightly increase your risk of developing breast cancer because your exposure to oestrogen is uninterrupted by&nbsp;<a>pregnancy</a>.</p>\n<h2>Being overweight or obese</h2>\n<p>If you\'ve experienced the menopause and are overweight or&nbsp;<a>obese</a>, you may be more at risk of developing breast cancer. This is thought to be linked to the amount of oestrogen in your body, because being overweight or obese after the menopause causes more oestrogen to be produced.</p>\n<h2>Being tall</h2>\n<p>If you\'re taller than average, you\'re more likely to develop breast cancer than someone who\'s shorter than average.&nbsp;The reason for this isn\'t fully understood, but it may be due to interactions between genes, nutrition and hormones.</p>\n<h2>Alcohol</h2>\n<p>Your risk of developing breast cancer can increase with the&nbsp;<a>amount of alcohol you drink</a>. Research shows that for every 200 women who regularly have two alcoholic drinks a day, there are three more women with breast cancer, compared with women who don\'t drink at all.</p>\n<h2>Radiation</h2>\n<p>Certain medical procedures that use radiation, such as&nbsp;<a >X-rays</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a>computerised tomography (CT) scans</a>, may slightly increase your risk of developing breast cancer.</p>\n<p>If you had&nbsp;<a>radiotherapy</a>&nbsp;to your chest area for&nbsp;<a>Hodgkin lymphoma</a>&nbsp;when you were a child, you should have already received a written invitation from the Department of Health for a consultation with a specialist to discuss your increased risk of developing breast cancer. See your GP if you weren\'t contacted, or if you didn\'t attend a consultation.</p>\n<p>If you currently need radiotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma, your specialist should discuss the risk of breast cancer before your treatment begins.</p>\n<h2>Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)</h2>\n<p><a>Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)</a>&nbsp;is associated with a slightly increased risk of developing breast cancer. Both combined HRT and oestrogen-only HRT can increase your risk of developing breast cancer, although the risk is slightly higher if you take combined HRT.</p>\n<p>It\'s estimated that there will be an extra 19 cases of breast cancer for every 1,000 women&nbsp;taking combined HRT for 10 years. The risk continues to increase slightly the longer you take HRT, but returns to normal once you stop taking it.</p>\n<h2>Diagnosing breast cancer</h2>\n<div class=\"editor\">\n<p>If you have suspected breast cancer, either&nbsp;because of&nbsp;your symptoms or because your mammogram has shown an abnormality, you\'ll be referred to a specialist breast clinic for further tests.</p>\n<h2>What to expect at the breast clinic</h2>\n<p>The tests you\'ll receive at the breast clinic depend on your current symptoms, your age, and the results of the initial examination you\'ll have when you arrive. Many people don\'t need any further tests after the initial examination.</p>\n<p>Most of the time you can expect to spend up to 2 hours at the breast clinic.</p>\n<h3>Mammogram and breast ultrasound</h3>\n<p>If you have symptoms and have been referred by your GP, you\'ll meet a specialist who\'ll examine you to determine if you need further tests.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you\'re under&nbsp;40 years of age, the specialist&nbsp;may suggest you only have a breast ultrasound scan. This is because younger women have denser breasts, which means a mammogram isn\'t as effective as an ultrasound&nbsp;for diagnosing breast disease.</p>\n<p>If you have a mammogram, it will produce an&nbsp;<a>X-ray</a>&nbsp;of your breasts. You may also need an&nbsp;<a>ultrasound scan</a>.</p>\n<p>Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your breasts, showing any lumps or abnormalities. Your doctor may also suggest a breast ultrasound if they need to know whether a lump in your breast is solid or contains liquid.</p>\n<h3>Biopsy</h3>\n<p>A&nbsp;<a>biopsy</a>&nbsp;is where a sample of tissue cells is taken from your breast and tested to see if it\'s cancerous. You may also need a scan and a needle test on lymph nodes in your armpit (axilla) to see whether these are also affected.</p>\n<p>Biopsies can be taken in different ways, and the type you have will depend on what your doctor knows about your condition.&nbsp;Different methods of&nbsp;carrying out&nbsp;a biopsy are discussed below.</p>\n<p>Needle aspiration may be used to test a sample of your breast cells for cancer or to drain a benign cyst (a small fluid-filled lump). Your doctor will use a small needle to extract a sample of cells, without removing any tissue.</p>\n<p>Needle biopsy is the most common type of biopsy. A sample of tissue is taken from a lump in your breast using a large needle. You\'ll have a&nbsp;<a>local anaesthetic</a>, which means you\'ll be awake during the procedure, but your breast will be numb.</p>\n<p>Your doctor may suggest that you have a guided needle biopsy (usually guided by ultrasound or X-ray, but sometimes MRI is used) to obtain a more precise and reliable diagnosis of cancer and to distinguish it from any non-invasive change, particularly ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).</p>\n<p>Vacuum-assisted biopsy, also known as a mammotome biopsy, is another type of biopsy. During the procedure, a needle&nbsp;is attached to a gentle suction tube, which helps to&nbsp;obtain the sample and clear any bleeding from the area.</p>\n<h2>Further tests for breast cancer</h2>\n<p>If a diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed, more tests will be needed to determine the stage and grade of the cancer, and to work out the best method of treatment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If&nbsp;your&nbsp;cancer was detected through the NHS Breast Screening Programme, you\'ll have further tests in the screening centre before being referred for treatment.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Scans and X-rays</h3>\n<p><a>Computerised tomography (CT) scans</a>, or chest X-ray and liver ultrasound scans, may be needed to check whether the cancer has spread to your lungs or liver. An MRI scan of the breast may be needed to clarify or to assess the extent of the condition within the breast.</p>\n<p>If your doctor thinks that the cancer could have spread to your bones, you may need a bone scan. Before having a bone scan, a substance containing a small amount of radiation, known as an isotope, will be injected into a vein in your arm. This will be absorbed into your bone if it\'s been affected by cancer. The affected areas of bone will show up as highlighted areas on the bone scan, which is carried out using a special camera.</p>\n<h3>Tests to determine specific types of treatment</h3>\n<p>You\'ll also need tests that show whether the cancer will respond to specific types of treatment. The results of these tests can give your doctors a more complete picture of the type of cancer you have and how best to treat it. The types of test you could be offered are discussed below.</p>\n<p>In some cases, breast cancer cells can be stimulated to grow by hormones that occur naturally in your body, such as oestrogen and progesterone.</p>\n<p>If this is the case, the cancer may be treated by stopping the effects of the hormones, or by lowering the level of these hormones in your body. This is known as \"hormone therapy\".</p>\n<p>During&nbsp;a hormone receptor test, a sample of cancer cells will be taken from your breast and tested to see if they respond to either oestrogen or progesterone. If the hormone is able to attach to the cancer cells (using a hormone receptor), they\'re known as \"hormone receptor positive\".</p>\n<p>While hormones can encourage the growth of some types of breast cancer, other types are stimulated by a protein called&nbsp;human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2).</p>\n<p>These types of cancer can be diagnosed using a HER2 test, and treated with medication to block the effects of HER2. This is known as \"biological\" or \"targeted\" therapy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Stage and grade of breast cancer</h2>\n<h3>Stage of breast cancer</h3>\n<p>When your breast cancer is diagnosed, the doctors will give it a stage. The stage describes the size of the cancer and how far it has spread.</p>\n<p>Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is sometimes described as Stage 0. Other stages of breast cancer describe invasive breast cancer (see below).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stage 1 &ndash; the tumour measures less than 2cm and the lymph nodes in the armpit aren\'t affected. There are no signs that the cancer has spread elsewhere in the body.</li>\n<li>Stage 2 &ndash; the tumour measures 2-5cm or the lymph nodes in the armpit are affected, or both. There are no signs that the cancer has spread elsewhere in the body.</li>\n<li>Stage 3 &ndash; the tumour measures&nbsp;2-5cm and may be attached to structures in the breast, such as skin or surrounding tissues. The lymph nodes in the armpit are affected. However, there are no signs that the cancer has spread elsewhere in the body.</li>\n<li>Stage 4 &ndash; the tumour is of any size and the cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastasis).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is a simplified guide. Each stage is divided into further categories: A, B and C. If you\'re not sure what stage you have, ask your doctor.</p>\n<h3>TNM staging system</h3>\n<p>The TNM staging system may also be used to describe breast cancer, as it can provide accurate information about the diagnosis. T describes the size of the tumour, N describes whether cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, and M gives an indication of whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.</p>\n<h3>Grade of breast cancer</h3>\n<p>The grade describes the appearance of the cancer cells.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Low grade (G1) &ndash; the cells, although abnormal, appear to be growing slowly.</li>\n<li>Medium grade (G2) &ndash; the cells look more abnormal than low-grade cells.</li>\n<li>High grade (G3) &ndash; the cells look even more abnormal and are more likely to grow quickly.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Treatment overview</h2>\n<p>Surgery is usually the first type of treatment for breast cancer. The type of surgery you undergo will depend on the type of breast cancer you have.</p>\n<p>Surgery is usually followed by chemotherapy or radiotherapy or, in some cases, hormone or biological treatments. Again, the treatment you\'ll have will depend on&nbsp;your type of breast cancer.</p>\n<p>Your doctor will discuss the most suitable treatment&nbsp;plan with you. Chemotherapy or hormone therapy will sometimes be the first treatment.</p>\n<h2>Secondary breast cancer</h2>\n<p>Most breast cancers are discovered in the condition\'s early stages. However, a small proportion of women discover that they have breast cancer after it\'s spread to other parts of the body (known as metastasis).</p>\n<p>If this is the case, the type of treatment you have may be different. Secondary cancer, also called \"advanced\" or \"metastatic\" cancer, isn\'t curable and treatment aims to achieve remission (where the cancer shrinks or disappears, and you feel normal and able to enjoy life to the full).</p>\n<p>Want to know more?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Breast Cancer Now:&nbsp;<a>Secondary breast cancer</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Surgery</h2>\n<p>There are two main types of breast cancer surgery. They are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>surgery to remove the cancerous lump (tumour), known as breast-conserving surgery</li>\n<li>surgery to remove the whole breast, which is called a&nbsp;<a>mastectomy</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In many cases, a mastectomy can be followed by reconstructive surgery to try to recreate a bulge to replace the breast that was removed.</p>\n<p>Studies have shown that breast-conserving surgery followed by radiotherapy is as successful as total mastectomy at treating early-stage breast cancer.</p>\n<h2>Breast-conserving surgery</h2>\n<p>Breast-conserving surgery ranges from a lumpectomy or wide local excision, where&nbsp;just the tumour and a little surrounding breast tissue is removed, to a partial mastectomy or quadrantectomy, where&nbsp;up to a quarter of the breast is removed.</p>\n<p>If you have breast-conserving surgery, the amount of breast tissue you have removed will depend on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the type of cancer you have&nbsp;</li>\n<li>the size of the tumour and where it is in your breast</li>\n<li>the amount of surrounding tissue that needs to be removed</li>\n<li>the size of your breasts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your surgeon will always remove an area of healthy breast tissue around the cancer, which will be tested for traces of cancer. If there\'s no cancer present in the healthy tissue, there\'s less chance that the cancer will reoccur. If cancer cells are found in the surrounding tissue, more tissue may need to be removed from your breast.</p>\n<p>After having breast-conserving surgery, you will usually be offered radiotherapy to destroy any remaining cancer cells.</p>\n<h2>Mastectomy</h2>\n<p>A mastectomy is the removal of all the breast tissue, including the nipple. If there are no obvious signs that the cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, you may have a mastectomy, where your breast is removed, along with a sentinel lymph node biopsy (see below).</p>\n<p>If the cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, you will probably need more extensive removal (clearance) of lymph nodes from the axilla (under your arm).</p>\n<h2>Reconstruction</h2>\n<p>Breast reconstruction is surgery to make a new breast shape that looks as much as possible like your other breast. Reconstruction can be carried out at the same time as a mastectomy (immediate reconstruction), or it can be carried out later (delayed reconstruction). It can be done either by inserting a breast implant or by using tissue from another part of your body to create a new breast.</p>\n<p>Want to know more?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Breast Cancer Now:&nbsp;<a>Breast reconstruction</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Lymph node surgery</h2>\n<p>To find out if the cancer has spread, a procedure called a sentinel lymph node biopsy&nbsp;may be carried out.</p>\n<p>The sentinel lymph nodes are the first lymph nodes that the cancer cells reach if they spread. They\'re part of the lymph nodes under the arm (axillary lymph nodes). The position of the sentinel lymph nodes varies, so they\'re identified using a combination of a radioisotope and a blue dye.</p>\n<p>The sentinel lymph nodes are examined in the laboratory to see if there are any cancer cells present. This provides a good indicator of whether the cancer has spread.</p>\n<p>If there are cancer cells in the sentinel nodes, you may need further surgery to remove more lymph nodes from under the arm.</p>\n<p>Want to know more?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a>Predict</a>: Decide on the ideal course of treatment following breast cancer surgery</li>\n<li>Cancer Research UK:&nbsp;<a>Types of breast cancer surgery</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Radiotherapy</h2>\n<p>Radiotherapy uses controlled doses of radiation to kill cancer cells. It\'s usually given after surgery and chemotherapy to kill any remaining cancer cells.</p>\n<p>If you need radiotherapy, your treatment will begin about a month after your surgery or chemotherapy, to give your body a chance to recover. You\'ll probably have radiotherapy sessions three to five days a week, for&nbsp;three to six weeks. Each session will only last a few minutes.</p>\n<p>The type of radiotherapy you have will depend on your cancer and surgery type. Some women may not need to have radiotherapy at all. The types available are:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>breast radiotherapy &ndash; after breast-conserving surgery, radiation is applied to the whole of the remaining breast tissue</li>\n<li>chest wall radiotherapy &ndash; after a mastectomy, radiotherapy is applied to the chest wall</li>\n<li>breast boost &ndash; some women may be offered a boost of high-dose radiotherapy in the area where the cancer was removed; however, the boost may affect the appearance of the breast, particularly if you have large breasts, and can sometimes have other side effects, including hardening of the breast tissue (fibrosis)</li>\n<li>radiotherapy to the lymph nodes &ndash; where radiotherapy is aimed at the armpit (axilla) and the surrounding area to kill any cancer that may be present in the lymph nodes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The side effects of radiotherapy include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>irritation and darkening of the skin on your breast, which may lead to sore, red, weepy skin</li>\n<li>fatigue (extreme tiredness)</li>\n<li>lymphoedema&nbsp;(excess fluid build-up in your arm caused by blockage of the lymph nodes under your arm)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Want to know more?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Macmillan:&nbsp;<a>Radiotherapy for breast cancer</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Chemotherapy</h2>\n<p>Chemotherapy involves using anti-cancer (cytotoxic) medication to kill the cancer cells. It\'s usually used after surgery to destroy any cancer cells that haven\'t been removed. This is called adjuvant chemotherapy.</p>\n<p>In some cases, you may have chemotherapy before surgery, which is often used to shrink a large tumour. This is called neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.</p>\n<p>Several different medications are used for chemotherapy and three are often given at once. The choice of medication and the combination will depend on the type of breast cancer you have and how much it\'s spread.</p>\n<p>Chemotherapy is usually given as an outpatient treatment, which means&nbsp;you won\'t have to stay in hospital overnight. The medications are usually given through a drip straight into the blood through a vein.</p>\n<p>In some cases, you may be given tablets that you can take at home. You may have chemotherapy sessions once every&nbsp;two to three weeks, over a period of four to eight months, to give your body a rest in between treatments.</p>\n<p>The main side effects of chemotherapy are caused by their influence on normal, healthy cells, such as immune cells. Side effects include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>infections</li>\n<li>loss of appetite</li>\n<li>nausea and vomiting</li>\n<li>tiredness</li>\n<li><a>hair loss</a></li>\n<li>sore mouth</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many side effects can be prevented or controlled with medicines that your doctor can prescribe.</p>\n<p>Chemotherapy medication can also stop the production of oestrogen in your body, which is known to encourage the growth of some breast cancers.</p>\n<p>If you haven\'t experienced the menopause, your&nbsp;<a>periods</a>&nbsp;may&nbsp;stop while you\'re undergoing chemotherapy treatment. After you\'ve finished the course of chemotherapy, your ovaries should start producing oestrogen again.</p>\n<p>However, this doesn\'t always happen and you may enter an&nbsp;<a>early menopause</a>. This is more likely in women over 40 years old, because&nbsp;they\'re closer to menopausal age. Your doctor will discuss with you the impact that any treatment will have on your fertility.</p>\n<p><strong>Chemotherapy for secondary breast cancer</strong></p>\n<p>If your breast cancer has spread beyond the breast and lymph nodes to other parts of your body, chemotherapy won\'t cure the cancer, but it may shrink the tumour, relieve your symptoms and help lengthen your life.</p>\n<p>Want to know more?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Macmillan:&nbsp;<a>Chemotherapy for breast cancer</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Hormone treatment</h2>\n<p>Some breast cancers are stimulated to grow by the hormones oestrogen or progesterone, which are found naturally in your body.</p>\n<p>These types of cancer are known as hormone-receptor-positive cancers. Hormone therapy works by lowering the levels of hormones in your body or by stopping their effects.</p>\n<p>The type of hormone therapy you\'ll have will depend on the stage and grade of your cancer, which hormone it\'s sensitive to, your age, whether you\'ve experienced&nbsp;the menopause and what other type of treatment you\'re having.</p>\n<p>You\'ll probably have hormone therapy after surgery and chemotherapy, but it\'s sometimes given before surgery to shrink a tumour, making it easier to remove.</p>\n<p>Hormone therapy may be used as the only treatment for breast cancer if your general health prevents you from having surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy.</p>\n<p>In most cases, you\'ll need to take hormone therapy for up to five years after&nbsp;having surgery. If your breast cancer isn\'t sensitive to hormones, hormone therapy will have no effect.</p>\n<h3>Tamoxifen</h3>\n<p>Tamoxifen stops oestrogen from binding to oestrogen-receptor-positive cancer cells. It\'s taken every day as a tablet or liquid. It can cause several side effects, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>tiredness</li>\n<li>changes to your periods</li>\n<li>nausea and vomiting</li>\n<li>hot flushes</li>\n<li>aching joints</li>\n<li><a>headaches</a>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>weight gain</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Aromatase inhibitors</h3>\n<p>If you\'ve&nbsp;experienced the menopause, you may be offered an aromatase inhibitor. This type of medication works by blocking aromatase, a substance that helps produce oestrogen in the body after the menopause. Before the menopause, oestrogen is made by the ovaries.</p>\n<p>Three aromatase inhibitors may be offered. These are&nbsp;anastrozole, exemestane and letrozole. These are taken as a tablet once a day. Side effects include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>hot flushes and sweats</li>\n<li><a>lack of interest in sex (loss of libido)</a></li>\n<li>nausea and vomiting</li>\n<li>tiredness</li>\n<li>aching joints and bone pain</li>\n<li>headaches</li>\n<li>skin rashes</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Ovarian ablation or suppression</h3>\n<p>In women who haven\'t&nbsp;experienced the menopause, oestrogen is produced by the ovaries. Ovarian ablation or suppression stops the ovaries working and producing oestrogen.</p>\n<p>Ablation can be carried out using surgery or radiotherapy. It&nbsp;stops the ovaries working permanently and means you\'ll experience the menopause early.</p>\n<p>Ovarian suppression involves using a medication called goserelin, which is a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonist (LHRHa). Your periods will stop while you\'re taking it, although they should start again once your treatment is complete.</p>\n<p>If you\'re&nbsp;approaching the menopause (around the age of 50), your periods may not start again after you stop taking goserelin.</p>\n<p>Goserelin is taken as an injection once a month and can cause menopausal side effects, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>hot flushes and sweats</li>\n<li>mood swings</li>\n<li>trouble sleeping</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Want to know more?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Breast Cancer Now:&nbsp;<a>Hormone therapy</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Biological therapy (targeted therapy)</h2>\n<p>Some breast cancers are stimulated to grow by a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). These cancers are called HER2-positive. Biological therapy works by stopping the effects of HER2 and by helping your immune system to fight off cancer cells.</p>\n<p>If you have high levels of the HER2 protein and are able to have biological therapy, you\'ll probably be prescribed a medicine called trastuzumab. Trastuzumab, also known by the brand name Herceptin,&nbsp;is usually used after chemotherapy.</p>\n<h3>Trastuzumab</h3>\n<p>Trastuzumab is a type of biological therapy known as a monoclonal antibody. Antibodies occur naturally in your body and are made by your immune system to destroy harmful cells, such as viruses and bacteria. The trastuzumab antibody targets and destroys cancer cells that are HER2-positive.</p>\n<p>Trastuzumab is usually given intravenously, through a drip. It\'s also sometimes available as an injection under the skin (a subcutaneous injection).</p>\n<p>You will have the treatment in hospital. Each treatment session takes up to one hour and the number of sessions you need will depend on whether you have early or more advanced breast cancer. On average, you\'ll need a session once every three weeks for early breast cancer, and weekly sessions if your cancer is more advanced.</p>\n<p>Trastuzumab can cause side effects, including heart problems. This means that it\'s not suitable if you have a heart problem, such as&nbsp;<a>angina</a>, uncontrolled&nbsp;<a>high blood pressure (hypertension)</a>&nbsp;or heart valve disease. If you need to take trastuzumab, you\'ll have&nbsp;regular tests on your heart to make sure it\'s not causing any problems.</p>\n<p>Other side effects of trastuzumab may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>an initial allergic reaction to the medication, which&nbsp;can cause nausea, wheezing, chills and fever</li>\n<li>diarrhoea</li>\n<li>tiredness</li>\n<li>aches and pains</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Clinical trials</h2>\n<p>A great deal of progress has been made in breast cancer treatment, and more women now live longer and have fewer side effects from treatment.</p>\n<p>These advances were discovered in&nbsp;<a>clinical trials</a>, where new treatments and treatment combinations are compared with standard ones.</p>\n<p>All cancer trials in the UK are carefully overseen to ensure they\'re worthwhile and safely conducted. In fact, participants in clinical trials can do better overall than those&nbsp;in routine care.</p>\n<p>If you\'re asked to take part in a trial, you\'ll be given an information sheet and, if you want to take part, you\'ll be asked to sign a&nbsp;consent form. You can refuse or withdraw from a clinical trial without it affecting your care.</p>\n<p>Want to know more?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Breast Cancer Now:&nbsp;<a>Clinical trials</a></li>\n<li>Against Breast Cancer:&nbsp;<a >Our research</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Psychological help</h2>\n<p>Dealing with cancer can be a huge challenge, for both patients and their families. It can cause emotional and practical difficulties. Many women have to cope with the removal of part or all of a breast, which can be very upsetting.</p>\n<p>It often helps to talk about your feelings or other difficulties with a trained counsellor or therapist. You can ask for this kind of help at any stage of your illness.</p>\n<p>There are various ways to find help and support. Your hospital doctor, specialist nurse or GP can refer you to a counsellor. If you\'re feeling depressed, talk to your GP. A course of antidepressant drugs may help, or your GP can arrange for you to see a counsellor or psychotherapist.</p>\n<p>It can help to talk to someone who\'s been through the same thing as you. Many organisations have helplines and online forums. They can also put you in touch with other people who\'ve had cancer treatment.</p>\n<p>Want to know more?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Breast Cancer Now:&nbsp;<a>Someone to talk to</a></li>\n<li>Macmillan Cancer Support:&nbsp;<a>Online community</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Complementary therapies</h2>\n<p>Complementary therapies are holistic therapies that can promote physical and emotional wellbeing. They\'re given alongside conventional treatments and include&nbsp;<a>relaxation techniques</a>, massage, aromatherapy and acupuncture.</p>\n<p>Complementary therapy&nbsp;can help some women cope with diagnosis and treatment, and provide&nbsp;a break&nbsp;from the treatment plan.</p>\n<p>Your hospital or breast unit may be able to provide access to complementary therapies or suggest where you can&nbsp;get them. It\'s important to speak to your breast cancer specialist nurse about any complementary therapy you wish to use, to make sure it doesn\'t&nbsp;interfere with your conventional treatment.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(125,124,NULL,NULL,'<h1>Breast cancer (male):</h1>\n<h2>About breast cancer in men</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Breast cancer is often thought of as a condition that only affects women, but men can also develop it.</p>\n<p>It\'s&nbsp;much less common in men than women, with only around&nbsp;1 new case of breast cancer diagnosed for every 100,000 men (about 350 to 400 cases) in the UK each year.</p>\n<p>The cancer develops in the small amount of breast tissue men have behind their nipples. The most common symptom is a hard, painless lump in one of the breasts.</p>\n<p>However, the vast majority of breast lumps are caused by&nbsp;a condition called&nbsp;<a>gynaecomastia</a>. This is a common non-cancerous condition where male breast tissue becomes enlarged.</p>\n<p>Breast cancer in men can also cause nipple problems, such as the nipple turning in on itself (retraction) or nipple discharge.</p>\n<h2>When to see your GP</h2>\n<p>You should always talk to your GP if you notice a lump in your breast or you have problems affecting your nipples, such as discharge.</p>\n<p>While these symptoms are unlikely to be caused by breast cancer, they should be investigated further.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Why it happens</h2>\n<p>The cause of male breast cancer is unclear, but factors known to increase your chances of developing the condition include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>age &ndash; most cases affect men over the age of&nbsp;60</li>\n<li>having a family history of breast cancer (male or female)</li>\n<li><a>obesity</a>&nbsp;&ndash; a&nbsp;<a>body mass index (BMI)</a>&nbsp;of 30 or more</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Treating breast cancer in men</h2>\n<p>In most cases, surgery is used to remove the cancer, along with a section of the breast. This may be followed by a long-term course of hormone-blocking therapy using medication, usually&nbsp;a drug&nbsp;called tamoxifen.</p>\n<p>Tamoxifen helps block the effects of hormones&nbsp;known to stimulate the growth of cancerous cells in breast tissue. It should help prevent the cancer returning.</p>\n<p>In some cases,&nbsp;<a>radiotherapy</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>chemotherapy</a>&nbsp;may be used for the same purpose.</p>\n<h2>Outlook</h2>\n<p>The outlook for breast cancer is not as good in men as in women. This is because there\'s reduced awareness of the condition and it may take longer to diagnose.</p>\n<p>The survival rates for breast cancer in men largely depend on how far the cancer has spread before it\'s diagnosed.</p>\n<p>Breast cancer diagnosed at an early stage can often be treated successfully, but effective treatment is more difficult if the cancer has spread beyond the breast tissue.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, many cases are diagnosed after the cancer has already started to spread.</p>\n<h2>Reducing your risk</h2>\n<p>The most effective way of reducing your risk of developing breast cancer, as well as other serious health conditions, is to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a>drink alcohol in moderation</a>&nbsp;&ndash; men are advised to drink no more than 14 units of alcohol a week; a unit is approximately half a pint of normal-strength lager or a single measure (25ml) of spirits</li>\n<li><a>maintain a healthy weight</a>&nbsp;&ndash; through a combination of eating a&nbsp;<a>healthy diet</a>&nbsp;and exercising regularly</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Symptoms of breast cancer in men</h2>\n<div>\n<p>The main symptom of breast cancer in men is a hard lump in one of your breasts. The lump is almost always painless.</p>\n<p>The lump is usually located underneath the nipple and areola (the circle of dark-coloured skin surrounding the nipple).</p>\n<p>However, the vast majority of breast lumps are&nbsp;caused by&nbsp;a condition called&nbsp;<a>gynaecomastia</a>. This is a common non-cancerous condition where male breast tissue becomes enlarged.</p>\n<p>Less common symptoms of male breast cancer&nbsp;include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the nipple beginning to turn in on itself (nipple retraction)</li>\n<li>the nipple becoming hard and inflamed, and looking sore (nipple ulceration)</li>\n<li>fluid leaking from the nipple (nipple discharge)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Advanced symptoms</h2>\n<p>Additional symptoms usually only develop if the cancer spreads from the breast to other parts of the body, such as the bones, liver or lungs. This is known as metastatic breast cancer.</p>\n<p>Symptoms of metastatic breast cancer include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>bone pain</li>\n<li>swelling of the lymph nodes (glands), usually in or around the armpit</li>\n<li>shortness of breath</li>\n<li>feeling unusually tired all the time</li>\n<li>feeling sick (nausea)</li>\n<li>itchy skin&nbsp;with&nbsp;yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>When to seek medical advice</h2>\n<p>You should always visit your GP if you notice a lump in your breast or you have&nbsp;problems affecting your nipples, such as retraction, ulceration or discharge.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These problems&nbsp;are unlikely to be of the result of breast cancer, but they&nbsp;should be&nbsp;investigated further.</p>\n<h2>Causes of breast cancer in men</h2>\n<div>\n<p>It\'s not clear exactly what causes breast cancer in men, although a number of things can increase your risk of developing the condition.</p>\n<h2>Age</h2>\n<p>Like many cancers, men have an increased risk of developing breast cancer as they get older. Most cases are diagnosed in men aged 60 to 70. It\'s rare for young men to&nbsp;develop the condition.</p>\n<h2>Genetics and family history</h2>\n<p>A genetic mutation is&nbsp;a permanent alteration in the DNA sequence that makes up a gene.&nbsp;The result is that&nbsp;one or more of the body\'s processes may not work in the way they should.</p>\n<p>There are a number of genetic mutations known to increase your risk of developing breast cancer. The most significant mutation identified is known as the BRCA2 mutation. Faulty genes are believed to be the cause of male breast cancer in around&nbsp;1 or 2 in every 10 cases.</p>\n<p>There\'s also evidence that breast cancer can run in families, especially in men who have a first-degree relative who has developed breast cancer,&nbsp;such as a mother or sister.</p>\n<p>Routine testing for the faulty genes that cause breast cancer in men isn\'t usually carried out on the NHS, unless specifically requested by a specialist. However,&nbsp;some private clinics may offer gene testing. Tests can be expensive, with prices ranging from around &pound;2,000 to &pound;3,000.</p>\n<h2>Oestrogen</h2>\n<p>There\'s evidence that high levels of the hormone oestrogen, or prolonged exposure to it, can increase the risk of breast cancer in men.</p>\n<p>Compared&nbsp;with women, men tend to have low levels of oestrogen, but there are circumstances that can increase the levels of oestrogen in men. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>hormone treatments &ndash; man-made (synthetic) versions of oestrogen are often used to treat prostate cancer, and are also given to transgender patients&nbsp;undergoing a male to female sex change</li>\n<li>obesity &ndash; obese men have higher levels of oestrogen than normal</li>\n<li><a >cirrhosis</a>&nbsp;&ndash; this is scarring of the liver, often caused by long-term&nbsp;<a>alcohol misuse</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is also a rare genetic condition affecting males called&nbsp;<a>Klinefelter syndrome</a>. This is a congenital condition that&nbsp;boys are born with that means&nbsp;those who are&nbsp;affected&nbsp;produce less of the hormone testosterone than usual.</p>\n<p>As testosterone usually helps to limit the effect of oestrogen, men with Klinefelter syndrome are more likely to develop breast cancer than the general male population.</p>\n<h2>Occupational risks</h2>\n<p>There\'s some evidence men who work in hot environments are twice as likely to develop breast cancer compared with men who work in cooler environments.</p>\n<p>Environments linked to an increased risk of breast cancer in men include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>blast furnaces</li>\n<li>steelworks</li>\n<li>rolling mills &ndash; a factory where metal (usually steel) is shaped using rollers</li>\n<li>car manufacturing plants</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One hypothesis to help explain the link between working environment and the increased risk of developing breast cancer is that excessive heat may damage the testicles, which could lead to an increase in oestrogen levels.</p>\n<p>Another hypothesis is that working in hot environments usually involves exposure to certain chemicals that may increase the risk of developing breast cancer in men.</p>\n<p>Rates of breast cancer are also unusually high in men who manufacture perfumes and soaps. They are seven times more likely to develop breast cancer than the male population at large.</p>\n<p>The reason for this increased risk is still unclear. Exposure to certain chemicals seems to be an obvious possibility, but this hasn\'t yet been proven.</p>\n<h2>Radiation</h2>\n<p>Exposure to radiation has been linked to an increased risk of developing breast cancer in men.</p>\n<p>Research has found men who received a course of&nbsp;<a>radiotherapy</a>&nbsp;&ndash; where high energy X-rays are used to kill cancerous cells&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;directed at the upper chest were seven times more likely to develop male breast cancer compared&nbsp;with the population at large.</p>\n<p>However, even a seven-fold increase means the chance of developing breast cancer is still very low.</p>\n<h2>Diagnosing breast cancer in men</h2>\n<div>\n<p>If you have symptoms of breast cancer, such as a hard, painless lump in one of your breasts, your GP will carefully examine you.</p>\n<p>During the examination, they\'ll also look for other possible signs of male breast cancer, such as swollen lymph nodes (glands).</p>\n<p>It\'s likely your GP will refer you for further tests if there\'s a possibility you may have breast cancer. These tests are described below.</p>\n<h2>Mammogram</h2>\n<p>A mammogram is a type of&nbsp;<a>X-ray</a>&nbsp;used to help determine whether there are any changes in breast tissue that could be the result of cancer.</p>\n<p>During the mammogram procedure, a radiographer (a specialist in taking X-rays) will compress one of your breasts between two X-ray plates. This shouldn\'t be painful, but you should tell the radiographer if you find it uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>Once your breast has been correctly positioned, an X-ray will be taken that produces a clear image of the inside of your breast. The procedure will then be carried out on your other breast.</p>\n<h2>Ultrasound</h2>\n<p>An&nbsp;<a>ultrasound scan</a>&nbsp;uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your breasts, in the same way an unborn baby can be seen in the womb.</p>\n<p>An ultrasound probe or sensor will be placed over your breasts to create an image of the inside of your breasts on a screen. The image will highlight any lumps or abnormalities that may be present in your breasts.</p>\n<h2>Biopsy</h2>\n<p>A&nbsp;<a>biopsy</a>&nbsp;may be recommended if a mammogram or ultrasound scan highlight any lumps or abnormalities in your breasts.</p>\n<p>A biopsy is a test that can either confirm or rule out a diagnosis of breast cancer in men. It involves taking a sample of suspected cancerous tissue and examining it in a laboratory for the presence of cancerous cells.</p>\n<p>A type of biopsy known as a core biopsy is usually recommended for the diagnosis of breast cancer in men. This type of biopsy can usually indicate whether the cancer has started to spread from the breast into the surrounding area.</p>\n<p>During a core biopsy, a&nbsp;<a>local anaesthetic</a>&nbsp;will be used to numb your breast. A hollow needle will then be used to remove a number of small tissue samples from the breast lump.</p>\n<p>If cancer is found, it\'s also possible to check whether there are special proteins, known as oestrogen receptors, on the surface of the cancerous cells.</p>\n<p>This is important, because if oestrogen receptors are found&nbsp;&ndash; and they are in more than half&nbsp;of cases&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;it\'s possible to treat the cancer with hormone therapy.</p>\n<p>See&nbsp;<a>treating breast cancer in men</a>&nbsp;for more information</p>\n<h2>Staging</h2>\n<p>After breast cancer has been diagnosed, your care team should provide information about the stage of the cancer. Staging is a system used to describe how far a cancer has spread at the point of diagnosis.</p>\n<p>A cure may be possible if breast cancer is diagnosed at an early stage. However, treatment can only be used to control symptoms and slow the spread of the cancer if it\'s diagnosed at a later stage. Unfortunately, more than 40% of breast cancers in men are diagnosed at a late stage.</p>\n<p>In some cases, men are diagnosed with a type of breast cancer called ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). This means there are cancer cells in the breast, but they\'re contained within the breast ducts and can\'t spread.</p>\n<p>If left untreated, DCIS can lead to invasive breast cancer over a period of time.</p>\n<h2>Coping with a diagnosis</h2>\n<p>Being told you have breast cancer can cause a wide range of emotions, such as shock, fear, confusion and, in some cases, embarrassment.</p>\n<p>Most people assume breast cancer only affects women, so it can be difficult to come to terms with the diagnosis.</p>\n<p>Feelings of isolation and being alone are common in men with breast cancer. This may be because there\'s little in the way of advice and support for men with breast cancer, particularly when compared&nbsp;with the support available for women with the condition.</p>\n<p>Sometimes men who find themselves in this situation can become depressed. You may be&nbsp;<a>depressed</a>&nbsp;if you\'ve felt very down and no longer interested in doing activities you used to enjoy&nbsp;during the past month.</p>\n<p>If you think you may be depressed, visit your GP. There is a range of effective treatments, such as medication and counselling, that can help relieve feelings of depression.</p>\n<p>You may also find it useful to talk to other men affected by the condition.&nbsp;<a>Breast Cancer Now</a>&nbsp;is a breast cancer charity that provides an&nbsp;<a>online forum for anyone diagnosed with breast cancer</a>. Cancer Research UK also provides&nbsp;<a>Cancer Chat</a>, an online forum for anyone affected by cancer.</p>\n<h2>Screening for breast cancer in men</h2>\n<p>As breast cancer is&nbsp;rare in&nbsp;men, routine screening for the condition isn\'t recommended, even for men in high-risk groups, such as those with a family history of breast cancer or those who have had&nbsp;<a>radiotherapy</a>.</p>\n<h2>Treating breast cancer in men</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Treatment for breast cancer in men largely depends on how far the cancer has spread.</p>\n<p>Most hospitals use multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) to treat men with breast cancer. These are teams of specialists&nbsp;who work together to make decisions about the best way to proceed with your treatment.</p>\n<p>Deciding which treatment is best for you can often be confusing. Your cancer team will recommend what they think is the ideal treatment option, but the final decision will be yours.</p>\n<p>Before visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions you\'d like to ask the specialist. For example, you could ask about&nbsp;the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.</p>\n<h2>Your treatment plan</h2>\n<p>Your recommended treatment plan depends on how far the cancer has spread. If the cancer hasn\'t spread significantly beyond your breast, a complete cure may be possible.</p>\n<p>In these cases, surgery to remove the affected breast is usually recommended. This is often followed by&nbsp;<a>radiotherapy</a>, hormone therapy, or&nbsp;<a>chemotherapy</a>&nbsp;to help prevent the cancer returning.</p>\n<p>If the cancer has spread beyond your breast into other parts of your body, such as your lungs, a complete cure won\'t be possible. However, hormone therapy and chemotherapy can be used to relieve symptoms and slow down the spread of the cancer.</p>\n<p>More information about these treatments can be found below.</p>\n<h2>Surgery</h2>\n<p>An operation called a&nbsp;<a>mastectomy</a>&nbsp;is usually recommended as the first treatment for breast cancer.</p>\n<p>A mastectomy involves removing the entire breast,&nbsp;sometimes with the nipple and lymph nodes (glands) in the armpit. A procedure known as a&nbsp;sentinel lymph node biopsy may also be performed.</p>\n<p>In some cases, part of the muscle under the breast may also be removed if there\'s a risk the cancer has spread to this area.</p>\n<p>Once surgery has been completed, there will be a straight scar across your chest where your nipple used to be and possibly an indentation around the area where the breast tissue used to be.</p>\n<h3>After surgery</h3>\n<p>Most men are well enough to leave hospital one to three days after surgery.</p>\n<p>After the operation, it\'s likely you\'ll feel very tired and it may take a few weeks before you\'re well enough to start carrying out relatively strenuous activities, such as lifting objects or driving. Your specialist nurse will be able to offer more specific advice about this.</p>\n<p>The wound takes about two to three weeks to heal. It\'s important to keep the wound clean during this time.</p>\n<p>You should look for any signs that the wound may have become infected, such as redness and swelling around the wound or a discharge of pus. Inform your MDT as soon as possible if you suspect an infection.</p>\n<p>It\'s difficult to predict when you\'ll feel able to return to work. Some people choose to remain off work until other treatments, such as radiotherapy, have been completed.</p>\n<p>Others prefer to return to work in between treatments. Your MDT will be able to advise you, but the final decision will be yours.</p>\n<p>It can take several weeks to fully recover from the effects of a mastectomy. A structured exercise programme, where the intensity and amount of time spent exercising is gradually increased, will probably be recommended.</p>\n<p>Your&nbsp;treatment team&nbsp;will be able to provide you with more advice or refer you to a physiotherapist (a specialist with training in rehabilitation using exercise).</p>\n<h3>Complications of surgery</h3>\n<p>After&nbsp;surgery, you may experience numbness or tingling at the site of the scar and in your upper arm. This is common, and is&nbsp;caused by nerve damage during surgery.</p>\n<p>The numbness and tingling should pass within a few weeks or months, although it can occasionally be permanent.</p>\n<p>Another&nbsp;possible complication is painful swelling in the arms. This is called&nbsp;<a>lymphoedema</a>, which is caused by the disruption of the lymphatic system (a series of channels and lymph nodes normally responsible for removing excess fluid from tissue).</p>\n<p>If many lymph nodes are surgically removed, it can disrupt the lymphatic system\'s ability to drain fluid, which can lead to swelling.</p>\n<p>There\'s no cure for lymphoedema, but it\'s possible to control the symptoms using a combination of different techniques, such as massage and compression garments.</p>\n<p>See&nbsp;<a >treating lymphoedema</a>&nbsp;for more information</p>\n<h2>Radiotherapy</h2>\n<p><a>Radiotherapy</a>&nbsp;is a type of treatment involving a machine that releases high-energy waves to destroy cancerous cells. It can be given a few weeks after surgery to prevent the cancerous cells returning.</p>\n<p>A typical course of radiotherapy involves two to five sessions a week over the course of three to six weeks. The sessions are short and usually only last for 10 to 15 minutes.</p>\n<p>Radiotherapy isn\'t usually painful, although you\'ll probably experience some side effects. This is because the energy released during radiotherapy can also damage healthy cells.</p>\n<p>Common side effects of radiotherapy can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>extreme tiredness (fatigue)</li>\n<li>feeling sick (nausea)</li>\n<li>sore, red and irritated skin on the breast similar in appearance to&nbsp;<a>sunburn</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The side effects of radiotherapy should pass after your course of treatment has finished, although some men experience prolonged fatigue for several months.</p>\n<p>Radiotherapy can also be used in cases of advanced breast cancer to slow down the spread of the cancer and relieve the symptoms of pain. This is known as palliative radiotherapy.</p>\n<p>Palliative radiotherapy is usually given in just one or two doses and doesn\'t usually cause any side effects.</p>\n<h2>Hormone therapy</h2>\n<p>Up to&nbsp;90% of cases of breast cancers in men are oestrogen receptor positive, or ER+. \"E\" is used because the American spelling of oestrogen is \"estrogen\".</p>\n<p>This means the cancerous cells require oestrogen to grow. Oestrogen is a type of hormone found in low levels in men and much higher levels in women.</p>\n<p>The aim of hormone therapy is to block the effects of oestrogen on the breast tissue to prevent the cancer recurring after surgery. It can also be used in cases of advanced breast cancer to slow down the spread of the cancer.</p>\n<h3>Tamoxifen</h3>\n<p>Tamoxifen is&nbsp;one of the hormone-blocking&nbsp;medications widely used for breast cancer. It\'s available in tablet or liquid form, and prevents oestrogen entering the breast tissue cells.</p>\n<p>The ideal length of treatment with tamoxifen is unclear. Studies in women with breast cancer suggest a five-year course of treatment is the most effective for preventing the return of cancer and extending survival rates. However, it\'s unclear if this also applies to men.</p>\n<p>Tamoxifen can also cause unpleasant side effects, which will be taken into consideration when your&nbsp;treatment team&nbsp;is deciding which treatments to recommend. You can discuss the pros and cons of long-term treatment with tamoxifen with your doctors.</p>\n<p>Side effects of tamoxifen can&nbsp;include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>reduced interest in sex&nbsp;<a>(loss of&nbsp;libido)</a></li>\n<li>inability to obtain or maintain an erection&nbsp;<a>(erectile dysfunction)</a></li>\n<li><a>headache</a></li>\n<li>feeling sick&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;taking your medication with food may help reduce this side effect</li>\n<li>changes in mood, such as feeling irritable or&nbsp;<a>depressed</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should inform your&nbsp;team if you experience side effects that become particularly troublesome, as alternative medications are available.</p>\n<h3>Aromatase inhibitors</h3>\n<p>Aromatase inhibitors are an alternative&nbsp;type of hormone medication. They may be used if tamoxifen proves unsuccessful or the side effects of tamoxifen are particularly troublesome. Aromatase inhibitors can also be used to slow the spread of advanced breast cancer.</p>\n<p>In men, oestrogen is created when a protein called aromatase converts another hormone called androgens. Aromatase inhibitors block the effects of aromatase, which in turn lowers the amount of oestrogen in the body.</p>\n<p>Aromatase inhibitors are usually given in tablet form and taken daily for two to five years. As with tamoxifen, there\'s little available evidence about the most effective length of dosage in men, compared with female breast cancer.</p>\n<p>Side effects of aromatase inhibitors can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>joint pain</li>\n<li>lack of energy</li>\n<li>hot flushes</li>\n<li>skin rashes</li>\n<li>feeling sick</li>\n<li>being sick</li>\n<li>thinning of the hair</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, it\'s unlikely you\'ll experience any or all of these side effects.</p>\n<h2>Chemotherapy</h2>\n<p><a>Chemotherapy</a>&nbsp;is used to treat cases of breast cancer where hormone therapy would be largely ineffective because the cancerous cells are not oestrogen receptor positive (ER+).</p>\n<p>It\'s usually given after surgery to help prevent the cancer returning, or it\'s used to treat the symptoms of incurable cancer.</p>\n<p>Chemotherapy for breast cancer involves taking a combination of cancer-killing medications. Treatment is usually given every two to three weeks over the course of six months.</p>\n<p>You may be given chemotherapy tablets (oral chemotherapy), chemotherapy injections (intravenous chemotherapy), or a combination of both.</p>\n<p>The side effects of chemotherapy can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>feeling sick</li>\n<li>being sick</li>\n<li><a >diarrhoea</a></li>\n<li>loss of appetite</li>\n<li><a>mouth ulcers</a></li>\n<li>tiredness</li>\n<li>skin rashes</li>\n<li><a >infertility</a></li>\n<li><a>hair loss</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The side effects should resolve once your treatment has finished.&nbsp;Your hair should grow back about three to six months&nbsp;after treatment.</p>\n<p>Chemotherapy can also weaken your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection. It\'s important to&nbsp;tell your MDT about&nbsp;any symptoms of a potential infection, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above</li>\n<li>flu-like symptoms, such as chills or joint pain</li>\n<li>a general sense of feeling unwell</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should also avoid close contact with people known to have an infection.</p>\n<p>If you\'re sexually active, you should use a condom for 48 hours after receiving a dose of chemotherapy medication. This is because the medication used in chemotherapy could pass into your semen and cause irritation in the tissue of your partner\'s genitals.</p>\n<p>You should avoid having children while receiving chemotherapy as many of the medications can damage your sperm and increase your chances of having a baby with a birth defect. Again, using a reliable method of contraception, such as a condom, is recommended</p>\n<p>Depending on the medications used, it may be several months after your course of chemotherapy has ended before you can safely have children. Your MDT will be able to give you a more detailed recommendation.</p>\n<h2>Biological therapy</h2>\n<p>Biological therapy uses medication to block the effects of a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in cases where HER2 is contributing to breast cancer.</p>\n<p>Biological therapies are sometimes referred to as targeted therapies because they are designed to target biological processes that cancers rely on to grow and reproduce.</p>\n<p>If you have high levels of the HER2 protein and&nbsp;are able to have biological therapy, you\'ll probably be prescribed a medicine called trastuzumab.&nbsp;Also known by the brand name Herceptin, it&nbsp;is usually used after radiotherapy or chemotherapy to prevent cancerous cells returning.</p>\n<h3>Trastuzumab</h3>\n<p><a>Trastuzumab</a>&nbsp;is a type of biological therapy known as a monoclonal antibody. Antibodies occur naturally in the body and are created by the immune system to destroy harmful cells, such as viruses and bacteria. The trastuzumab antibody targets and destroys cancer cells designed to respond to the HER2 protein.</p>\n<p>Trastuzumab is given through a drip, directly into a vein (intravenously). You\'ll receive the treatment in hospital. Each treatment session takes up to one hour, and the number of sessions you need depends on whether your breast cancer is in its early or more advanced stages.</p>\n<p>On average, for early breast cancer you\'ll need to have a session once every three weeks, and for more advanced cancer you\'ll need to have weekly sessions.</p>\n<p>Trastuzumab can cause side effects, including heart problems. This means it\'s not suitable if you have a heart problem, such as&nbsp;<a>angina</a>, uncontrolled&nbsp;<a>high blood pressure</a>&nbsp;(hypertension), or heart valve disease.</p>\n<p>If you need to take trastuzumab, you\'ll need to have regular tests on your heart to ensure it\'s not causing any problems.</p>\n<p>Other side effects of trastuzumab&nbsp;can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>an initial allergic reaction to the medication, which can cause nausea, wheezing, chills and fever</li>\n<li><a>diarrhoea</a></li>\n<li>tiredness</li>\n<li>aches and pains</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(126,125,NULL,NULL,'<h1>Eye cancer:</h1>\n<h2>About eye cancer</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Between 500 and 600 cases of eye cancer (ocular cancer) are diagnosed in the UK each year.</p>\n<p>There are a number of different types of cancer that affect the eyes, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>eye melanoma</li>\n<li>squamous cell carcinoma</li>\n<li><a>lymphoma</a></li>\n<li><a>retinoblastoma</a>&nbsp;&ndash; a childhood cancer</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cancer can also sometimes develop in the tissues surrounding your eyeball or spread to the eye from other&nbsp;parts of the body, such as the lungs or breasts.</p>\n<p>This topic focuses on melanoma of the eye, one of the most common types of eye cancer.&nbsp;The&nbsp;<a>Cancer Research UK</a>&nbsp;website has&nbsp;more information about&nbsp;<a>other types of eye cancer</a>.</p>\n<p>This page covers:</p>\n<p><a>Symptoms of eye cancer</a></p>\n<p><a>About melanoma of the eye</a></p>\n<p><a>What causes eye melanoma?</a></p>\n<p><a>Diagnosing melanoma of the eye</a></p>\n<p><a>Treatments for eye melanoma</a></p>\n<p><a>Outlook for eye melanoma</a></p>\n<h2>Symptoms of eye cancer</h2>\n<p>Eye cancer doesn\'t always cause obvious symptoms and may only be picked up during a routine eye test.</p>\n<p>Symptoms of eye cancer can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>shadows, flashes of light, or wiggly lines in your vision</li>\n<li>blurred vision</li>\n<li>a dark patch in your&nbsp;eye that\'s getting bigger</li>\n<li>partial or total loss of vision</li>\n<li>bulging of one eye</li>\n<li>a lump on your eyelid or in&nbsp;your eye that\'s increasing in size</li>\n<li>pain in or around your eye, although this is rare</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These symptoms can also be caused by more minor eye conditions, so they\'re not necessarily a sign of cancer.

Most&nbsp;melanomas develop in the skin, but it\'s also possible for them to occur in other parts of the body, including the eye.</p>\n<p>Eye melanoma most commonly affects the eyeball. Doctors sometimes call it&nbsp;uveal or choroidal melanoma, depending on exactly which part of your eye is affected.</p>\n<p>It&nbsp;can also affect the conjunctiva, the thin&nbsp;layer that covers the front of the eye, or the eyelid.</p>\n<h2 id=\"causes\">What causes eye melanoma?</h2>\n<p>Eye melanoma occurs when&nbsp;the pigment-producing cells in the eyes divide and multiply too rapidly.

Around 800 people in the UK are diagnosed with the condition each year.</p>\n<p>There are a number of different types of gallbladder cancer,&nbsp;depending on the cells affected.</p>\n<p>Over 85% of gallbladder cancers are adenocarcinoma, which means the&nbsp;cancer&nbsp;started in the gland cells lining the gallbladder.</p>\n<p>Cancer that starts in the skin-like cells that line the gallbladder is known as squamous cell cancer.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<a>Cancer Research UK</a>&nbsp;website has more information about the&nbsp;<a>different types of gallbladder cancer</a>.</p>\n<p>Cancer of the gallbladder is more common in women than men, with around 7 out of 10 cases diagnosed in women. It\'s also more common in older people, particularly those over 70 years of age.</p>\n<h2>The gallbladder</h2>\n<p>The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ that\'s located underneath the liver. It\'s main purpose is to store and concentrate bile.</p>\n<p>Bile is a liquid produced by the liver that helps to digest fats. It passes from the liver through a series of channels (bile ducts) into the gallbladder, where it\'s stored.</p>\n<p>Over time, bile becomes more concentrated, which makes it better at digesting fats. The gallbladder releases bile into the digestive system when it\'s needed.</p>\n<p>The gallbladder is a useful but not essential organ, which can be safely removed without interfering with your ability to digest food.</p>\n<h2>Symptoms of gallbladder cancer</h2>\n<p>In the early stages, gallbladder cancer doesn\'t cause symptoms, which&nbsp;means it could be at an advanced stage by the time it\'s diagnosed.</p>\n<p>Symptoms that occur at a later stage can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>abdominal (stomach) pain</li>\n<li>feeling sick</li>\n<li>jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These symptoms could be linked to&nbsp;a number of conditions and may not be related to gallbladder cancer.

It\'s not known why this happens, but certain things are thought to increase your chances of developing the condition.</p>\n<p>Gallbladder cancer is more common in older people, and your chances of developing it increase with age. In the UK, most cases occur in people over the age of 70.</p>\n<p>Lifestyle factors &ndash; such as&nbsp;<a>obesity</a>, smoking and an unhealthy diet &ndash; are believed to increase the risk of gallbladder cancer. However, there\'s not enough evidence to show a firm link between diet and gallbladder cancer.</p>\n<p>There are also a number of conditions that can increase your chances of developing gallbladder cancer.

Only one of the kidneys is usually affected by cancer.</p>\n<p>The human body is made up of billions of cells, which normally grow and multiply in an orderly way, with new cells being created only when and where they\'re needed. In cancer, this orderly process goes wrong and cells begin to grow and multiply uncontrollably.</p>\n<p>Exactly what triggers this growth&nbsp;is unknown; however, there are certain risk factors that can increase the chances of the condition developing, such as&nbsp;<a>smoking</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a>obesity</a>.</p>\n<p>Kidney cancer most frequently affects people over 50 years of age and is more common among men.</p>\n<h2>Types of kidney cancer</h2>\n<p>Many different types of cancer can affect the kidneys. The most common type is renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which accounts for&nbsp;more than 80%&nbsp;of all kidney cancers.</p>\n<p>Rarer types of kidney cancer include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>transitional cell cancer &ndash; develops in the lining of the kidneys and usually affects men who are 50 years of age or over</li>\n<li>Wilms&rsquo; tumour &ndash; a rare type of kidney cancer that affects children</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This topic focuses on RCC. See the&nbsp;<a>Cancer Research UK</a>&nbsp;website for more information about&nbsp;<a>transitional cell cancer</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a>Wilms&rsquo; tumour</a>.</p>\n<h2>Treating kidney cancer</h2>\n<p>The earlier kidney cancer is diagnosed, the easier it is to treat.</p>\n<p>How it\'s treated will depend on the size and spread of the cancer. Surgery to remove the cancerous cells is usually the first course of action.</p>\n<p>Unlike most other cancers,&nbsp;<a>chemotherapy</a>&nbsp;isn\'t very effective at treating kidney cancer. However, non-surgical treatments are available, such as&nbsp;<a>radiotherapy</a>&nbsp;or targeted therapies. These are most commonly used in the more advanced stages of kidney cancer, when the cancer has spread beyond the kidney.</p>\n<h2>Preventing kidney cancer</h2>\n<p>As the causes of kidney cancer aren\'t fully understood, it\'s not possible to fully prevent it.</p>\n<p>However, leading a healthy lifestyle may reduce the chances of developing the condition. A combination of a&nbsp;<a>healthy diet</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a>regular exercise</a>&nbsp;will help to avoid becoming overweight or obese, which is a significant risk factor for kidney cancer.</p>\n<p>If you\'re overweight or obese, you can lose weight and maintain a healthy weight by combining regular exercise with a calorie-controlled diet.</p>\n<h2>Outlook</h2>\n<p>The outlook for kidney cancer is usually good if the condition is diagnosed in its early stages, when the cancer is still contained inside the kidney.</p>\n<p>Kidney cancer can often be completely cured by removing some or all of the kidney. This is&nbsp;because it\'s possible to live a healthy life with only one kidney. Around one in three cases of kidney cancer are diagnosed at an early stage.</p>\n<p>Depending on how aggressive the cancer is, 65-90% of people will live at least five years after receiving an early&nbsp;diagnosis of kidney cancer, with many people living much longer.</p>\n<p>The outlook for kidney cancer that\'s spread outside the kidney is less favourable. Around 40-70% of people with this stage of kidney cancer will live at least five years after receiving a diagnosis.</p>\n<p>In cases where kidney cancer is advanced and has spread to other parts of the body, only around 10% of&nbsp;people will live for at least five years after receiving a diagnosis.</p>\n<h2>Symptoms of kidney cancer</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Most cases of kidney cancer don\'t cause any symptoms in the early stages.</p>\n<p>The most common symptoms of mid- to advanced-stage kidney cancer are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>blood in your urine (haematuria) &ndash; the amount of blood is usually high enough to change the colour of your urine to a reddish or dark brown colour</li>\n<li>a&nbsp;persistent&nbsp;pain in your side, just below the ribs</li>\n<li>a lump or swelling in the area of your&nbsp;kidneys (on either side of the body)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, in around half of all cases, the cancer causes no symptoms and is only detected during a routine&nbsp;<a>ultrasound scan</a>.</p>\n<p>Less common symptoms of kidney cancer include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>extreme tiredness (fatigue) or&nbsp;<a>anaemia</a></li>\n<li>unintentional weight loss</li>\n<li>a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above</li>\n<li>night sweats&nbsp;</li>\n<li>a general sense of feeling unwell</li>\n<li>swelling of the veins in the testicles (in men)</li>\n<li>loss of appetite</li>\n<li><a>high blood pressure (hypertension)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>When to seek medical advice</h2>\n<p>See&nbsp;your GP immediately if you have pain or a swelling or lump in your kidney area (on either side of your body, just below your ribcage).</p>\n<p>You should also see your GP if you&nbsp;have blood in your urine. Although it\'s highly unlikely to be caused by kidney cancer, it could&nbsp;be&nbsp;a symptom of a less serious condition that still requires treatment, such as a&nbsp;<a>kidney stone</a>&nbsp;or bladder stone.</p>\n<h2>Causes and risk factors of kidney cancer</h2>\n<div class=\"editor\">\n<p>The exact cause of kidney cancer is unknown, but there are risk factors that can increase the chances of developing the condition.</p>\n<p>The three main risk factors for kidney cancer are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>obesity</li>\n<li>smoking</li>\n<li>family history and genetics</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Obesity</h2>\n<p>Obesity is&nbsp;a significant risk factor for kidney cancer.</p>\n<p>A study carried out by&nbsp;<a>Cancer Research UK</a>&nbsp;in 2011 found that around a quarter of kidney cancer cases are associated with being overweight or obese (25% of cases in men and 22% in women).</p>\n<p>There\'s a strong link between someone&rsquo;s&nbsp;body mass index (BMI) and their risk of developing kidney cancer. Read more about&nbsp;<a >how BMI is calculated</a>,&nbsp;and work out your BMI.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A BMI score of 25 or above has been shown to increase a person\'s chances of developing kidney cancer. Those with a BMI score of 30 or above are at particularly high risk.</p>\n<p>This may be because overweight or obese people, particularly women, have higher levels of a hormone called oestrogen in their body. It\'s thought that excess levels of oestrogen may stimulate the growth of cancerous cells.</p>\n<p>Cases of kidney cancer have been increasing over the last 40 years, which has been linked to rising obesity levels.</p>\n<h2>Smoking</h2>\n<p>Smoking is also a&nbsp;significant risk factor for developing kidney cancer, and the more you smoke the greater the risk.</p>\n<p>For example, research has shown that if you regularly smoke 10 cigarettes a day, you\'re one-and-a-half times&nbsp;more likely to develop kidney cancer compared to a non-smoker. This increases to twice as likely&nbsp;if you smoke 20 or more cigarettes a day.</p>\n<p>It\'s not clear why smoking increases your chances of developing kidney cancer.</p>\n<h2>Family history and genetics</h2>\n<p>If you have a close family member (parents, brothers, sisters or a child) who\'s been diagnosed with kidney cancer, you\'re about twice as likely to develop kidney cancer yourself.</p>\n<p>Examples of inherited genetic conditions and syndromes that increase your risk of developing kidney cancer include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>tuberous sclerosis &ndash; a rare genetic condition that causes multiple non-cancerous (benign) tumours to grow in the body; it&rsquo;s autosomal dominant, which means you only have to inherit the faulty gene from one parent to get it; about one in every 100 people with tuberous sclerosis will develop kidney cancer</li>\n<li>hereditary papillary kidney cancer &ndash; a rare form of cancer caused by faulty genes inherited from your parents; it&rsquo;s autosomal dominant and causes small, slow-growing, cancerous tumours to develop in the kidneys, which can sometimes spread</li>\n<li>hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) &ndash; a rare, autosomal dominant form of cancer, where cancerous tumours develop from smooth muscle tissue (leiomyomatas); people with HLRCC have a 10-16% increased risk of developing kidney cancer</li>\n<li>Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome &ndash; a rare genetic syndrome that causes small non-cancerous tumours to develop inside the nervous system; VHL is also autosomal dominant and about 4 out of 10 people who have it develop kidney cancer</li>\n<li>Birt-Hogg-Dub&eacute; syndrome &ndash; an inherited syndrome that causes non-cancerous tumours to develop in the hair follicles of the skin; they usually occur on the face, neck and torso</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Other&nbsp;possible risk factors</h2>\n<p>There are also a&nbsp;number of other possible risk factors for developing kidney cancer, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>mild painkillers &ndash; some mild painkillers have been linked to an increased risk of developing kidney cancer;&nbsp;<a>NSAIDs</a>, such as&nbsp;<a>ibuprofen</a>, may slightly increase the risk, although occasional use or low doses are unlikely to be harmful</li>\n<li><a>kidney disease</a>&nbsp;&ndash; if you have kidney failure and need to have regular&nbsp;<a>dialysis</a>&nbsp;(treatment to replicate the functions of the kidneys), your risk of developing kidney cysts and kidney cancer is increased</li>\n<li><a>high blood pressure (hypertension)</a>&nbsp;&ndash; high blood pressure is a known risk factor for kidney disease, and you\'re up to twice as likely to develop kidney cancer if you have raised blood pressure</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Diagnosing kidney cancer</h2>\n<div class=\"editor\">\n<p>In many cases, kidney cancer is diagnosed after routine scans and check-ups, as the condition doesn\'t always have obvious symptoms.</p>\n<h2>Seeing&nbsp;your GP</h2>\n<p>You should see a&nbsp;GP if you have any symptoms of kidney cancer,&nbsp;such as&nbsp;blood in your urine or a constant pain below your ribs.</p>\n<p>Your GP will examine you and, if they think your symptoms need further assessment, refer you to a specialist urologist (a doctor who&nbsp;specialises in&nbsp;conditions that affect the urinary tract).</p>\n<p>If you notice blood in your urine,&nbsp;your GP will usually&nbsp;carry out a&nbsp;<a>blood test</a>&nbsp;and take a urine sample. The results will help rule out other&nbsp;possible causes, such as infection or&nbsp;<a>kidney stones</a>.</p>\n<p>In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (<a>NICE</a>) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of&nbsp;renal (kidney) cancer&nbsp;and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected&nbsp;kidney cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on&nbsp;<a>Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral</a>.</p>\n<p>If you need to be referred urgently, you\'ll usually be seen within two weeks.</p>\n<h2>Further tests</h2>\n<p>If your GP refers you to a hospital specialist,&nbsp;further tests will help&nbsp;determine whether you have kidney cancer.</p>\n<h3>Ultrasound scan</h3>\n<p>An&nbsp;<a>ultrasound scan</a>&nbsp;uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of an organ in the body. It can often detect changes in the shape of the kidney that might be&nbsp;caused by&nbsp;a cancerous tumour.</p>\n<p>An ultrasound scan may be needed if the cause of the blood in your urine can\'t be found.</p>\n<h3>Computerised tomography scan</h3>\n<p>You may also be referred for a&nbsp;<a>computerised tomography (CT) scan</a>. During a CT scan, a series of detailed images of the inside of your body are taken and put together by a computer.</p>\n<p>If you have a CT scan, you may be given a special dye to drink, or it may be injected. The dye makes the results of the CT scan clearer.</p>\n<h3>Image-guided biopsy</h3>\n<p>In some cases of kidney cancer, an image-guided&nbsp;<a>biopsy</a>&nbsp;is carried out. It\'s a minor surgical procedure performed under&nbsp;<a>local anaesthetic</a>.&nbsp;This means you\'ll be awake during the procedure, but the&nbsp;area surrounding the affected kidney will be numbed, so that you don\'t feel anything.</p>\n<p>During an image-guided biopsy, a radiologist or surgeon will use an ultrasound or CT scan to guide a needle through your skin and into your kidney. A small tissue sample will be removed from your kidney and examined under a microscope to check for cancerous cells.</p>\n<h3>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan</h3>\n<p>You may also need to have a&nbsp;<a>magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan</a>, which can be used to&nbsp;produce detailed images of your kidneys. The images can help identify a tumour and determine&nbsp;its size.</p>\n<h3>Cystoscopy</h3>\n<p>A&nbsp;cystoscopy is a medical procedure that uses an instrument called a cystoscope to examine the&nbsp;inside of your bladder and urinary system.</p>\n<p>This procedure&nbsp;doesn\'t look at&nbsp;the kidneys, but it can rule out or confirm whether any bleeding is coming from problems in the bladder.</p>\n<h3>Intravenous pyelogram (IVP)</h3>\n<p>An intravenous pyelogram (IVP) test involves injecting a dye into your bloodstream.&nbsp;<a>X-rays</a>&nbsp;are taken after a short time, with the dye highlighting any growths present in the kidneys.</p>\n<h2>Staging and grading</h2>\n<p>If kidney cancer is confirmed, it\'s usually possible to determine its grade and stage.</p>\n<p>The stage describes how far the cancer has spread, and the grade describes how aggressive the cancer is and how quickly it\'s likely to spread.</p>\n<p>Both the stage and grade of your kidney cancer will help determine your recommended treatment and the likelihood of achieving a cure.</p>\n<p>Healthcare professionals use the TNM system&nbsp;to stage kidney cancer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>T &ndash; indicates how large the tumour has grown (a tumour is a lump of cancerous tissue)</li>\n<li>N &ndash; indicates whether nearby lymph nodes are affected (lymph nodes are small, oval-shaped glands found throughout the body, which help protect against infection)</li>\n<li>M &ndash; indicates whether the cancer has spread to another part of the body (M stands for metastases, which is the medical term for cancer that has spread)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The stages of tumour size are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>T1a &ndash; where the tumour is less than 4cm (about 1.6 inches)&nbsp;in diameter</li>\n<li>T1b &ndash; where the tumour is 4-7cm (about 1.6-2.8 inches) in diameter</li>\n<li>T2 &ndash; where the tumour is larger than 7cm (2.8 inches)&nbsp;in diameter, but hasn\'t spread out of the kidney</li>\n<li>T3a &ndash; where the tumour has spread into the adrenal gland or the layer of fat surrounding the kidney</li>\n<li>T3b &ndash; where the tumour has spread into the renal vein (the vein that carries blood back from the kidney to the heart) or into the vena cava (the vein that carries blood back from the top half of the body)</li>\n<li>T3c &ndash; where the tumour has spread past the diaphragm (the sheet of muscle that separates the top part of the abdomen from the bottom part)</li>\n<li>T4 &ndash; where the tumour has spread beyond the tough layer of tissue that surrounds and protects the kidney</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are three lymph node stages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>N0 &ndash; where no lymph nodes have been affected</li>\n<li>N1 &ndash; where there are cancer cells in one lymph node</li>\n<li>N2 &ndash; where there are cancer cells in two or more lymph nodes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>M0 means that the cancer hasn\'t spread to another part of the body. M1 means that the cancer has spread.</p>\n<p>Kidney cancer is graded using a scale of one to four. The higher the grade, the more aggressive the cancer.</p>\n<h2>Coping with cancer</h2>\n<p>Being diagnosed with cancer can be very distressing, particularly if it\'s incurable. The news can often be difficult to take in and comprehend.</p>\n<p>After cancer has been diagnosed, you may find that talking to a counsellor or psychiatrist helps you deal with&nbsp;feelings of&nbsp;<a>depression</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a>anxiety</a>.&nbsp;<a>Antidepressants</a>&nbsp;may also be used to help you through this process.</p>\n<h2>Treating kidney cancer</h2>\n<div>\n<p>The treatment of kidney cancer depends on the size and spread of the cancer. Surgery is the most common first course of action, with the aim of removing the cancer cells.</p>\n<p>Unlike most other cancers, chemotherapy isn\'t very effective in treating kidney cancer. However, there are non-surgical treatments available, such as radiotherapy or targeted drug therapies.</p>\n<p>The main treatments for kidney cancer are covered in detail below and&nbsp;include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a>nephrectomy</a></li>\n<li><a>embolisation</a></li>\n<li><a >radiotherapy</a>&nbsp;</li>\n<li><a >targeted therapies</a>&nbsp;</li>\n<li><a>immunotherapy</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Your treatment plan</h2>\n<p>You can expect to be cared for by a multidisciplinary team, often comprising a specialist cancer surgeon, an oncologist (who specialises in radiotherapy and&nbsp;<a>chemotherapy</a>), a radiologist, a nephrologist (a kidney specialist) and a specialist nurse.</p>\n<p>You\'ll be&nbsp;given a key worker, usually&nbsp;the specialist nurse, who will be responsible for coordinating your care.</p>\n<p>Your team will recommend what they think is the best treatment option, but the final decision will be yours.</p>\n<p>When deciding what treatment is best for you, your doctors will consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the&nbsp;<a>stage and grade of your cancer</a>&nbsp;(how big it is and how far it\'s spread)</li>\n<li>your age and general health</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the cancer hasn\'t spread out of your kidney (T1 or T2 kidney cancer), it can usually be cured by removing some or all of the kidney.</p>\n<p>If the cancer has spread out of your kidney (T3 or T4 kidney cancer), a complete cure may not be possible. However, it should be possible to slow the cancer\'s progression and treat any symptoms.</p>\n<h2>Surgical treatments</h2>\n<h3>Nephrectomy</h3>\n<p>A nephrectomy is an operation to remove a kidney.</p>\n<p>If the tumour is less than 4cm (1.5 inches) in diameter, it may only be necessary to remove some of your kidney. This is known as a partial nephrectomy. A partial nephrectomy may also be required if your remaining kidney is in poor health.</p>\n<p>If the tumour is more than 4cm in diameter, your entire kidney will need to be removed. Even if the cancer has spread beyond your kidney, you may still benefit from having your kidney removed.</p>\n<p>Removing the kidney can help resolve the pain, and make other types of non-surgical treatment more effective.</p>\n<p>It\'s possible to live a normal life with only one kidney, because the other kidney will be able to compensate.</p>\n<p>During a nephrectomy, the surgeon may also remove nearby lymph nodes to make sure the cancer hasn\'t spread beyond the kidney.</p>\n<p>There are two ways that both a partial and open nephrectomy can be performed They are an:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>open nephrectomy &ndash; where the kidney is removed through a large incision in your abdomen (stomach)</li>\n<li>laparoscopic or keyhole nephrectomy &ndash; where&nbsp;a series of smaller incisions are made in your abdomen, and the kidney is removed using small surgical instruments</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both techniques have advantages and disadvantages.</p>\n<p>A laparoscopic nephrectomy has a considerably quicker recovery time than an open nephrectomy.</p>\n<p>However, the procedure requires surgeons with specialised training, so you may have to wait longer to receive treatment than you would if you&nbsp;decided to have an open nephrectomy.</p>\n<p>Some types of kidney cancer, where the tumour is located in the centre of the kidney, may not be suitable for a laparoscopic nephrectomy.</p>\n<p>One of the main disadvantages of an open nephrectomy is that it\'s a major surgical procedure that can place a considerable strain on the body. This means it may not be suitable for people who are particularly frail or unwell.</p>\n<p>You should discuss the pros and cons of both procedures with your surgical team.</p>\n<h3 id=\"embolisation\">Embolisation</h3>\n<p>If you\'re unable to have a nephrectomy, you may benefit from an alternative&nbsp;operation known as embolisation.</p>\n<p>During embolisation, the surgeon will insert a small tube called a catheter into your groin, then use&nbsp;<a>X-ray</a>&nbsp;images to guide the catheter into the blood supply of your kidney. A substance will then be injected through the catheter to block the blood supply to your kidney.</p>\n<p>By blocking blood supply to the kidney, any tumours that are present will become starved of oxygen and nutrients, causing them to shrink.</p>\n<h2>Non-surgical treatments for advanced kidney cancer</h2>\n<p>Kidney cancer is one of the few types of cancer that\'s less responsive to&nbsp;<a>chemotherapy</a>&nbsp;(where powerful medication is used to kill cancerous cells).</p>\n<p>However, a number of&nbsp;clinical trials are underway that are looking at new combinations of chemotherapy medications that appear to be benefiting some people.</p>\n<p>There are also a number of different non-surgical treatments that can slow the spread of the cancer and help control its symptoms.</p>\n<h3>Radiotherapy</h3>\n<p><a>Radiotherapy</a>&nbsp;can\'t usually cure kidney cancer, but it can&nbsp;slow down its progress and help reduce pain. You should only need a few minutes of radiotherapy every day, for a number of days.</p>\n<p>When radiotherapy is used to control the symptoms of cancer rather than cure it, the side effects tend to be mild. Possible side effects may include fatigue (tiredness), nausea and vomiting</p>\n<h3>Cryotherapy</h3>\n<p>Cryotherapy involves killing cancer cells by freezing them. It may be&nbsp;used if a person isn\'t fit enough for surgery, or if their tumour is small.</p>\n<p>Cryotherapy is usually classed as either percutaneous (where needles are&nbsp;passed through the skin) or laparoscopic (where needles are placed directly into the kidney through a small incision).</p>\n<p>Side effects include bleeding around the kidney and injury to the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder (the ureter).</p>\n<h3>Radiofrequency ablation</h3>\n<p>Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) uses heat generated by radio waves to kill cancer cells. This is a percutaneous treatment, meaning no incision is needed.</p>\n<p>This treatment is only available at specialist centres. It\'s mainly used if you\'re not strong enough for surgery or your kidney cancer is in the early stages.</p>\n<p>RFA&nbsp;can\'t be used if the cancer is too close to other organs, such as the bowel.</p>\n<p>Side effects include bleeding in the treatment area, a collection of blood (haematoma) near the kidney, and problems passing urine due to the narrowing of the tube that joins the kidney to the bladder (the ureter).</p>\n<p>Want to know more?</p>\n<h2>Targeted therapies</h2>\n<p>A number of&nbsp;new medicines have been developed for the treatment of kidney cancer. These are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sunitinib&nbsp;</li>\n<li>pazopanib</li>\n<li>axitinib</li>\n<li>sorafenib</li>\n<li>temsirolimus</li>\n<li>everolimus</li>\n<li>bevacizumab</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These medicines are sometimes referred to as \"targeted therapies\" because they\'re designed to target and interrupt the functions needed by cancer to grow and spread.</p>\n<p>At present, only sunitinib, pazopanib and axitinib&nbsp;have been recommended by the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/\">National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)</a>. They\'re available on the NHS for people who are still relatively healthy and have advanced kidney cancer, or kidney cancer that\'s spread to other parts of their body.</p>\n<p>Sorafenib, temsirolimus, everolimus and bevacizumab aren\'t currently recommended by NICE.</p>\n<h3>Sunitinib</h3>\n<p>Sunitinib is the most commonly prescribed treatment for kidney cancer. It&rsquo;s a type of medication known as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Tyrosine kinase is an enzyme (protein) that helps cancer cells to grow. Sunitinib works by blocking protein kinase, stopping cancer from growing.</p>\n<p>Sunitinib is taken as a capsule with or without food. You take it once a day for four weeks before having a two-week break. This six-week cycle is repeated for as long as the treatment is effective.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s very important that you take sunitinib in the exact dosage that&rsquo;s been prescribed for you. Never stop taking medication for cancer without first consulting your specialist.</p>\n<p>Common side effects of sunitinib include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>nausea</li>\n<li>diarrhoea</li>\n<li><a>high blood pressure (hypertension)</a></li>\n<li>hair discolouration</li>\n<li>mouth soreness</li>\n<li>skin discolouration</li>\n<li>skin rashes or blisters</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The&nbsp;<a>Cancer Research UK</a>&nbsp;website has more information about&nbsp;<a>sunitinib and its side effects</a>.</p>\n<h3>Pazopanib</h3>\n<p>Like sunitinib, pazopanib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that can be used to slow down or stop the growth of cancer cells in the kidneys.&nbsp;It also prevents cancer cells from developing blood vessels, which they need to grow.</p>\n<p>Pazopanib is taken as a tablet once a day with a glass of water. You should take it about the same time each day, either at least an hour before eating or two hours afterwards. It&rsquo;s important that you take it in the exact dosage that your specialist has prescribed for you.</p>\n<p>Common side effects of pazopanib include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>nausea</li>\n<li><a>diarrhoea</a>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>high blood pressure</li>\n<li>hair discolouration</li>\n<li>abnormal liver function&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Cancer Research UK website has more information about&nbsp;<a>pazopanib and its side effects</a>.</p>\n<h3>Axitinib</h3>\n<p>Axitinib may be recommended for treating advanced kidney cancer if sunitinib and/or pazopanib have stopped working or haven&rsquo;t been effective.</p>\n<p>Like sunitinib and pazopanib, axitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks tyrosine kinase and stops cancer growing.</p>\n<p>Axitinib is taken as a tablet with a glass of water twice a day, about 12 hours apart. Your specialist may start you on a low dose which, depending on how you feel, may be increased after two weeks.

It also prevents cancer cells from developing blood vessels which they need to grow.</p>\n<p>Sorafenib is taken as a tablet twice a day (at the same time each day) with a glass of water. It can also be taken with a meal, but make sure the food is low-fat, because high-fat foods make it less effective.</p>\n<p>Again, it&rsquo;s very important that you take sorafenib as instructed by your doctor at the exact dosage prescribed for you.</p>\n<p>Common side effects of sorafenib include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>diarrhoea</li>\n<li>fatigue</li>\n<li>nausea and vomiting</li>\n<li>hair thinning (in around one in four people)</li>\n<li>increased risk of bleeding &ndash; such as&nbsp;<a>nosebleeds</a>&nbsp;or bleeding gums</li>\n<li>loss of fertility</li>\n<li>flushed skin</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Cancer Research UK website has more information about&nbsp;<a>sorafenib and its side effects</a>.</p>\n<h3>Temsirolimus</h3>\n<p>Temsirolimus is sometimes used to treat advanced kidney cancer. It&rsquo;s a type of medication known as an mTOR inhibitor, which blocks a protein called mTOR, that&rsquo;s usually active in cancer cells, making them reproduce and multiply. Temsirolimus also prevents blood vessels from developing, which cancer cells need to grow.</p>\n<p>Temsirolimus is a liquid that&rsquo;s delivered directly into the bloodstream, either through a tube that&rsquo;s put into a vein in your arm (catheter), or a tube into a large vein in your chest (a central line). The treatment takes 30-60 minutes and you have it once a week in hospital. Before each dose, an antihistamine is usually given to prevent an allergic reaction.</p>\n<p>Common side effects of temsirolimus include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>red, dry, itchy skin</li>\n<li>nausea and vomiting</li>\n<li>lack of appetite</li>\n<li>diarrhoea</li>\n<li>a sore mouth or&nbsp;<a>mouth ulcers</a></li>\n<li>sleeping problems</li>\n<li>loss of fertility</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Cancer Research UK website has more information about&nbsp;<a>temsirolimus and its side effects</a>.</p>\n<h3>Everolimus</h3>\n<p>Everolimus is a medication for advanced kidney cancer that&rsquo;s returned during or following treatment. It stops some of the signals produced within cells that make them grow and divide. Everolimus prevents the mTOR protein from working properly, which plays an important role in the growth of cancer cells.</p>\n<p>Everolimus is taken as a tablet once a day at the same time each day. It should be swallowed whole with a glass of water, rather than being chewed or crushed. It can be taken with or without food. It&rsquo;s very important that everolimus is taken using the exact dosage and method prescribed.</p>\n<p>Common side effects of everolimus include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a sore mouth</li>\n<li>tiredness</li>\n<li>a rash or itchy, dry skin</li>\n<li>loss of appetite</li>\n<li>nausea and vomiting</li>\n<li>a lack of&nbsp;periods in women (this may be temporary)</li>\n<li>loss of fertility</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Cancer Research UK website has more information about&nbsp;<a>everolimus and its side effects</a>.</p>\n<h2>Immunotherapy</h2>\n<p>As well as medications that prevent, disrupt and slow down the growth and development of kidney cancer (kinase and mTOR inhibitors), there are also treatments that work by encouraging the immune system to attack cancer cells. This type of treatment is known as immunotherapy.</p>\n<p>Bevacizumab is a medication that&rsquo;s given intravenously (into a vein, through a drip). It blocks a protein called endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which helps cancer to grow. Bevacizumab is usually used in combination with&nbsp;an immunotherapy treatment called interferon. Interferon is taken as an injection just under the skin (subcutaneously), three times a week. It encourages your immune system to attack and destroy the cancer cells.</p>\n<p>Another medication called aldesleukin is sometimes used to treat kidney cancer that&rsquo;s spread. It&rsquo;s similar to a natural protein the body produces called interleukin-2 (IL-2), which is part of the immune system. IL-2 activates lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell), which fight illnesses and infections.</p>\n<p>Aldesleukin works in a number of ways. It interferes with how cancer cells grow and multiply, it stimulates the immune system into attacking cancer cells, and it makes cancer cells send out chemicals that attract immune system cells. Like interferon, aldesleukin is usually given as a subcutaneous injection.</p>\n<p>Immunotherapy treatments are now rarely used to treat advanced kidney cancer. This is because targeted therapies tend to be more effective in controlling the condition, and immunotherapy can sometimes cause serious side effects.</p>\n<p>The Cancer Research UK website has more information about&nbsp;<a>treatments for advanced kidney cancer</a>.

It plays an important&nbsp;role in helping you breathe and speak.</p>\n<p>In the UK, there are about 2,400 new cases of laryngeal cancer each year.</p>\n<p>The condition is more common in people over the age of 60. It\'s about four times more common in men than women.</p>\n<h2>Symptoms of laryngeal cancer</h2>\n<p>The main symptoms of laryngeal cancer include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a change in your voice, such as sounding hoarse</li>\n<li>pain when swallowing&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>difficulty swallowing</a>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>a lump or swelling in your neck</li>\n<li>a&nbsp;long-lasting&nbsp;<a>cough</a></li>\n<li>a persistent&nbsp;<a>sore throat</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>earache</a></li>\n<li>in severe cases, difficulty breathing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some people may also experience&nbsp;bad breath,&nbsp;<a>breathlessness</a>, a high-pitched wheezing noise&nbsp;when&nbsp;breathing, unexplained weight loss, or fatigue (extreme tiredness).</p>\n<h2>When to see your GP</h2>\n<p>You should visit your GP if you have had&nbsp;any of the main symptoms listed above for more than three weeks.</p>\n<p>These symptoms are often caused by less serious conditions, such as&nbsp;<a>laryngitis</a>, but it\'s a good idea to get them checked out.</p>\n<p>If necessary, your GP can refer you to a hospital specialist for further tests to confirm or rule out cancer.</p>\n<h2>What causes laryngeal cancer?</h2>\n<p>It\'s not clear exactly what causes laryngeal cancer, but your risk of getting the condition is increased by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>smoking tobacco</li>\n<li>regularly drinking large amounts of alcohol</li>\n<li>having a family history of head and neck cancer</li>\n<li>having an unhealthy diet</li>\n<li>exposure to certain chemicals and substances, such as asbestos and coal dust</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By adopting a healthy lifestyle, including avoiding alcohol and tobacco, you can significantly reduce your chances of developing laryngeal cancer.</p>\n<h2>How laryngeal cancer is treated</h2>\n<p>The main treatments for laryngeal cancer&nbsp;are&nbsp;<a>radiotherapy</a>, surgery and&nbsp;<a>chemotherapy</a>.</p>\n<p>Radiotherapy or surgery to remove the cancerous cells from the larynx can often cure laryngeal cancer if it\'s diagnosed early.</p>\n<p>If the cancer is advanced, a combination of surgery to remove part or all of the larynx, radiotherapy and chemotherapy can be used.</p>\n<p>If you have surgery to remove your larynx, you\'ll no longer&nbsp;be able to speak or breathe in the usual way. Instead, you will breathe through a permanent hole in your neck (stoma) and you will need additional treatment to help restore your voice.</p>\n<p>This may include an implant in your throat, or an electrical device&nbsp;you hold against your throat to produce sound.</p>\n<h2>Causes of laryngeal cancer</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Laryngeal cancer is caused by changes in the cells of the larynx, although it\'s not clear exactly why this happens.</p>\n<p>All cancers begin with a change in&nbsp;a cell\'s&nbsp;DNA.&nbsp;DNA provides our cells with a basic set of instructions, such as when to grow and reproduce.</p>\n<p>A change in&nbsp;DNA can alter the instructions that control cell growth, which means cells continue to grow instead of stopping when they should. This causes the cells to reproduce in an uncontrollable manner, producing a growth of tissue called a tumour.</p>\n<p>It\'s not known why the DNA inside the cells of the larynx is affected in cases of laryngeal cancer. But it appears that exposure to&nbsp;things that can damage the cells and tissue of the larynx increases the risk of cancer developing.</p>\n<h2>What can increase your risk?</h2>\n<p>A&nbsp;number of things can increase your chances of developing laryngeal cancer.</p>\n<h3>Alcohol and tobacco</h3>\n<p>Alcohol and tobacco are the two main things that can increase your risk of developing laryngeal cancer. They\'re&nbsp;thought to contain chemicals that can damage the cells of the larynx.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;more you drink or smoke, the higher your risk of developing laryngeal cancer.</p>\n<p>People who smoke more than 25 cigarettes a day, or people who have smoked for more than 40 years, have been found to be about 40 times more likely to develop laryngeal cancer than&nbsp;people who don\'t smoke.</p>\n<p>Compared to people who don\'t drink, people who regularly drink large amounts of alcohol are about three times more likely to develop laryngeal cancer.</p>\n<p>If you drink and smoke, your risk of laryngeal cancer increases even further. By stopping both drinking and smoking, you can significantly reduce your risk of developing the condition.</p>\n<h3>Family history</h3>\n<p>People who have a first-degree relative (parent, sibling or child) diagnosed with head or neck&nbsp;cancer are thought to be twice as likely to develop laryngeal cancer as someone without a family history.</p>\n<h3>Diet</h3>\n<p>There\'s evidence to suggest that a diet high in red meat, processed food and fried food&nbsp;might increase your risk of developing laryngeal cancer.</p>\n<p>Having&nbsp;a \"Mediterranean diet\" or a diet containing plenty of fruit and vegetables may reduce your risk.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Exposure to harmful&nbsp;substances</h3>\n<p>Having a job where you\'re exposed to high levels of certain substances may also increase your risk of developing laryngeal cancer. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>asbestos</li>\n<li>coal or wood dust</li>\n<li>paint or diesel fumes</li>\n<li>nickel</li>\n<li>sulphuric acid fumes</li>\n<li>formaldehyde (a chemical&nbsp;used in a wide range of industrial processes, such as paint manufacturing and cosmetics)</li>\n<li>isopropyl alcohol (often used as a cleaning solvent)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Diagnosing laryngeal cancer</h2>\n<div class=\"editor\">\n<p>If you have symptoms of laryngeal cancer, such as a hoarse voice and pain when swallowing, your GP will ask about your symptoms and recent medical history.</p>\n<p>They may also examine the inside and outside of your throat for abnormalities, such as lumps and swellings.</p>\n<p>If laryngeal cancer is suspected, you\'ll probably be referred to the ear, nose and throat (ENT) department of your local hospital for further testing.</p>\n<p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that&nbsp;anyone aged 45&nbsp;or over with persistent unexplained hoarseness or an unexplained lump in their neck should have an appointment with a specialist within two weeks.</p>\n<p>The main tests that may be carried out in hospital are described below.</p>\n<h2>Nasendoscopy</h2>\n<p>A nasendoscopy is a procedure used to get a clear view of your larynx.</p>\n<p>During the procedure, a small, flexible tube with a light and video camera at one end (endoscope) is&nbsp;inserted into one of your nostrils and passed down the back of your throat. The images from the endoscope are displayed on a monitor.</p>\n<p>You\'ll usually be awake while this is carried out and it may feel uncomfortable.&nbsp;A&nbsp;<a>local anaesthetic</a>&nbsp;spray is&nbsp;sometimes used to numb your nose and throat beforehand, so you don\'t feel any pain.</p>\n<h2>Laryngoscopy</h2>\n<p>If it wasn\'t possible to get a good view of your larynx during a nasendoscopy, or a possible problem is spotted, you may have a further test called a laryngoscopy.</p>\n<p>Like a nasendoscopy, this procedure involves using an endoscope to examine your larynx. However, the endoscope used during a laryngoscopy is longer and inserted through the mouth. This allows the larynx to be seen in greater detail.</p>\n<p>A laryngoscopy&nbsp;can be very uncomfortable, so it\'s usually carried out under&nbsp;<a>general anaesthetic</a>&nbsp;(where you\'re asleep). You should be able to leave hospital as soon as you\'ve recovered from the effects of anaesthetic, which is usually the same day or the day after.</p>\n<h2>Biopsy</h2>\n<p>During a&nbsp;nasendoscopy or&nbsp;laryngoscopy, your doctor may use small instruments to remove a sample of cells from your larynx so it can be examined for signs of cancer. This is known as a&nbsp;<a>biopsy</a>.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if you have a lump in your neck, a needle and syringe can be used to&nbsp;remove a tissue sample. This is known as fine needle aspiration.</p>\n<h2>Further testing</h2>\n<p>If the results of the biopsy show you have cancer and there\'s a risk it may have spread, you\'ll probably be referred for further testing to assess how widespread the cancer is. The tests may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a&nbsp;<a>computerised tomography (CT) scan</a>&nbsp;&ndash; a series of X-rays are taken to build up a more detailed three-dimensional picture of your larynx and the surrounding tissue</li>\n<li>a&nbsp;<a>magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan</a>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;a strong magnetic field and radio waves are used to produce a more detailed image of your larynx and the surrounding tissue</li>\n<li>a&nbsp;<a>PET-CT scan</a>&nbsp;&ndash; a CT scan is used to take pictures of the inside of your body after you\'ve been injected with&nbsp;a mildly radioactive substance that helps to show cancerous areas more clearly</li>\n<li>an&nbsp;<a>ultrasound scan</a>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;high-frequency sound waves are used to check for signs of cancer in the lymph nodes (glands found throughout the body) near the larynx</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Staging and grading</h2>\n<p>After these tests have been completed, your doctor should be able to tell you the extent of the cancer. This is known as the stage and grade of the cancer.</p>\n<p>Healthcare professionals use a system called the TNM system to stage laryngeal cancer. T describes the size of the tumour, N describes whether cancer has spread to the lymph nodes and M gives an indication of whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The T stage is given as a number from 1-4 &ndash; Small tumours confined to one part of the larynx are described as T1 tumours and large tumours that have grown into tissues outside the larynx are described as T4.</li>\n<li>The N stage is given as a number from 0-3 &ndash; N0 means the lymph nodes are not affected, whereas stages N2 to N3 mean that one or more lymph nodes are affected.</li>\n<li>The M stage is given as either M0 or M1 &ndash; M0 means the cancer has not spread to other parts of the body and M1 means that it has.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are also three different grades&nbsp;(1-3) used to describe&nbsp;laryngeal cancer. Lower-grade cancers, such as grade 1, tend to grow more slowly and are less likely to spread.&nbsp;Higher-grade cancers, such as grade 3,&nbsp;grow quickly and&nbsp;are more likely to spread.</p>\n<h2>Treating laryngeal cancer</h2>\n<div class=\"editor\">\n<p>The treatment for laryngeal cancer largely depends on the size of the cancer. The main treatments are radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy.</p>\n<p>Most hospitals use multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) of specialists that work together to decide&nbsp;the best way to proceed with your treatment.</p>\n<p>Members of your MDT will probably include a surgeon, a clinical oncologist (a specialist in the non-surgical treatment of cancer), and a specialist cancer nurse who will be responsible for co-ordinating your care.</p>\n<p>Your cancer team will recommend what they think is the best treatment option, but the final decision will be yours.</p>\n<p>Before visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions you\'d like to ask&nbsp;your care team. For example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.</p>\n<h2>Your treatment plan</h2>\n<p>Your recommended treatment plan will depend on the stage of the&nbsp;cancer (see&nbsp;<a>diagnosing laryngeal cancer</a>&nbsp;for more information on staging).</p>\n<p>If you have early-stage laryngeal cancer, it may be possible to remove the cancer using surgery (endoscopic resection) or&nbsp;<a>radiotherapy</a>&nbsp;alone. This may also be the case with slightly larger cancers, although a combination of surgery and radiotherapy is sometimes required.</p>\n<p>In later-stage laryngeal cancer, more extensive surgery may be needed. Radiotherapy and&nbsp;<a>chemotherapy</a>&nbsp;will probably be used in combination. In some cases, the entire larynx may have to be removed.</p>\n<p>A medication called cetuximab may be used in cases where chemotherapy is not suitable.</p>\n<p>These treatments are described below.</p>\n<h2>Radiotherapy</h2>\n<p>Radiotherapy uses controlled doses of high-energy radiation to destroy cancerous cells. It can be used as a treatment on its own for early-stage laryngeal cancer, or it can be used&nbsp;after surgery to stop cancerous cells returning. It\'s sometimes combined with chemotherapy.</p>\n<p>The energy beams used during radiotherapy have to be precisely targeted to your larynx.&nbsp;To ensure&nbsp;the beams are directed at the exact area, a special plastic mask will be made to hold your head in the right position. A mould of your face will be taken so that the mask can be made before treatment starts.</p>\n<p>Radiotherapy is usually given in short daily sessions from Monday to Friday, with a break from treatment at the weekend. The course of treatment usually lasts for three to seven weeks.</p>\n<p>As well as killing cancerous cells, radiotherapy can affect healthy tissue and has a number of side effects, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sore, red skin (similar to&nbsp;<a>sunburn</a>)</li>\n<li><a>mouth ulcers</a></li>\n<li><a>dry mouth</a></li>\n<li>loss of taste</li>\n<li>loss of appetite</li>\n<li>tiredness</li>\n<li>feeling sick</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your MDT will monitor any side effects and treat them when possible. For example, protective gels can be used to treat mouth ulcers, and medicines are available for a dry mouth.</p>\n<p>Radiotherapy can sometimes cause your throat tissue to become inflamed. Severe inflammation can cause breathing difficulties. Contact your key worker or visit&nbsp;<a>your local accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department</a>&nbsp;as soon as possible if you have difficulty breathing.</p>\n<p>Most side effects should pass within a few weeks of treatment finishing.</p>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;<a>radiotherapy</a>.</p>\n<h2>Surgery</h2>\n<p>There are three&nbsp;types of surgery that&nbsp;can be used to treat laryngeal cancer. They are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>endoscopic resection</li>\n<li>partial laryngectomy</li>\n<li>total laryngectomy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are described below.</p>\n<h3>Endoscopic resection</h3>\n<p>Endoscopic resection can be used&nbsp;in&nbsp;early-stage laryngeal cancer.</p>\n<p>During the procedure, a surgeon uses a special microscope to get a magnified view of the larynx. This allows them to remove the cancer either with a laser or small surgical instruments.</p>\n<p>An endoscopic resection is carried out under&nbsp;<a>general anaesthetic</a>, so you will&nbsp;be unconscious during the procedure and won\'t feel any pain.</p>\n<p>Your&nbsp;mouth and throat&nbsp;may feel sore for a few weeks after the operation and there\'s a risk of your voice changing as a result of the procedure, which can be permanent.</p>\n<h3>Partial laryngectomy</h3>\n<p>A partial laryngectomy can be used to treat some laryngeal cancers. The operation involves surgically removing the affected part of your larynx. Some of your vocal cords will be left in place, so you will still be able to talk, but your voice may be quite hoarse or weak.</p>\n<p>While your larynx is healing, you may find breathing difficult. Your surgeon&nbsp;may need to&nbsp;create a temporary hole in your neck, which will be attached to a tube you can breathe through. This is known as a temporary tracheostomy.</p>\n<p>Once your larynx has healed, the tube can be removed and the hole will heal, leaving a small scar.</p>\n<p>This operation is&nbsp;uncommon nowadays,&nbsp;as endoscopic resection is preferred whenever possible.</p>\n<h3>Total laryngectomy</h3>\n<p>A total laryngectomy is usually used to treat advanced laryngeal cancer. The operation involves removing your entire larynx. Nearby lymph nodes (small glands that form part of the immune system) may also need to be removed if the cancer has spread to them.</p>\n<p>As your vocal cords will be removed, you won\'t be able to speak in the usual way after the operation. However, there are several ways to help restore your speech.</p>\n<p>If you have a total laryngectomy, your surgeon will also need to create a permanent hole in your neck (called a stoma) to help you breathe after the operation.</p>\n<p>You will be given training on how to keep your stoma clean. Having a stoma can seem daunting and frightening at first, but most people get used to it after a few months.</p>\n<p>See&nbsp;<a>recovering from laryngeal cancer</a>&nbsp;for more information about speaking after surgery and looking after a stoma.</p>\n<h2>Chemotherapy</h2>\n<p>Chemotherapy uses powerful cancer-killing medicines to damage the DNA of the cancerous cells and stop them reproducing. It may be used to&nbsp;shrink a tumour before surgery or radiotherapy, or in combination with radiotherapy to make the radiotherapy more effective.</p>\n<p>It can also be used to&nbsp;treat laryngeal cancer that\'s advanced or has come back after treatment. In this situation, it can relieve symptoms and may slow the cancer\'s growth.</p>\n<p>Chemotherapy medication is usually given as an injection into a vein (intravenously) once every three or four weeks, for up to six months. You may need to stay in hospital for a few days&nbsp;during each treatment or you may just come in for a short visit each time.</p>\n<p>Chemotherapy can sometimes damage healthy tissue as well as the cancerous tissue. This, unfortunately, means side effects are common, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>feeling and being sick</li>\n<li>hair loss</li>\n<li>loss of appetite</li>\n<li><a>diarrhoea</a></li>\n<li>sore mouth and mouth ulcers</li>\n<li>tiredness</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chemotherapy can also weaken your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection and illness.</p>\n<p>It\'s therefore important to report any symptoms of potential infection to your&nbsp;MDT, such as a high temperature, chills or a persistent cough. You should also avoid close contact with people&nbsp;known to have an infection.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;side effects of chemotherapy should improve after your treatment has finished.</p>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;<a>chemotherapy</a>.</p>\n<h2>Cetuximab</h2>\n<p>Cetuximab is a type of medication called biological therapy. These medications target and disrupt the processes that cancerous cells use to grow and reproduce.</p>\n<p>Cetuximab can be used in combination with radiotherapy to treat more advanced laryngeal cancer, when it\'s not possible to use chemotherapy. For example, people with kidney or heart disease, or people with an ongoing infection, may not be able to have chemotherapy, because it could make them very ill.</p>\n<p>Cetuximab is given slowly&nbsp;through a drip into your vein (intravenously) for up to an hour or more. It\'s usually given weekly for&nbsp;up to seven&nbsp;weeks.</p>\n<p>Side effects of cetuximab are usually mild and include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>rashes</li>\n<li>feeling sick</li>\n<li><a>diarrhoea</a></li>\n<li><a>breathlessness</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cetuximab can also trigger allergic reactions in some people, which can cause problems such as a swollen tongue or throat. In a few cases,&nbsp;the reaction can be severe and potentially life-threatening.</p>\n<p>Most serious reactions occur within a day of treatment starting, so you\'ll be closely monitored once your treatment begins. If you have symptoms of a severe&nbsp;reaction, such as a rapid heartbeat or breathing problems, medication can be used to relieve them (such as&nbsp;<a>corticosteroids</a>).</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(131,130,NULL,NULL,'<h1>Liver cancer:</h1>\n<h2>About liver cancer</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Primary liver cancer is an uncommon but serious type of cancer that begins in the liver.</p>\n<p>This is a separate condition from secondary liver cancer, which occurs when cancer that first develops in another part of the body spreads to the liver.</p>\n<p>The rest of this article refers to primary liver cancer only. The Macmillan Cancer Support website has more information about&nbsp;<a>secondary liver cancer</a>.</p>\n<h2>Signs and symptoms</h2>\n<p>Symptoms of&nbsp;liver cancer are often vague and don\'t appear until the cancer is at an advanced stage.

However, the chances of developing the condition are high for people with risk factors for the condition.</p>\n<p>The number of people affected by liver cancer rises sharply with age, with around 8 in every 10 cases diagnosed in people aged 60 or older, although it also affects many people younger than this. Around two in every three cases affect men.</p>\n<p>Over the past few decades, rates of liver cancer in the UK have risen considerably, possibly as a result of increased levels of alcohol intake and obesity.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Diagnosis and screening</h2>\n<p>Liver cancer is usually diagnosed after a consultation with a GP and a referral to a hospital specialist for further tests, such as scans of your liver.</p>\n<p>However, regular check-ups for liver cancer (known as surveillance) are often recommended for people known to have a high risk of developing the condition, such as those with cirrhosis.</p>\n<p>Having regular check-ups helps ensure the condition is diagnosed early. The earlier&nbsp;liver cancer is diagnosed, the more effective&nbsp;treatment is likely to be.</p>\n<h2>How liver cancer is treated</h2>\n<p>Treatment for liver cancer depends on the stage the condition is at. If diagnosed&nbsp;early, it may be possible to remove the cancer completely.</p>\n<p>Treatment options in the early stages of liver cancer include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>surgical resection &ndash; surgery to remove a section of liver</li>\n<li><a>liver transplant</a>&nbsp;&ndash; where the liver is replaced with a donor\'s liver</li>\n<li>microwave or radiofrequency ablation &ndash; where microwaves or radio waves are used to destroy the cancerous cells</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, only a small proportion of liver cancers are diagnosed at a stage where these treatments are suitable. Most people are diagnosed when the cancer has spread too far to be removed or completely destroyed.</p>\n<p>In these cases, treatments such as&nbsp;<a>chemotherapy</a>&nbsp;will be used to&nbsp;slow down&nbsp;the spread of the cancer and relieve symptoms such as pain and discomfort.</p>\n<h2>Liver cancer prognosis</h2>\n<p>Because liver cancer is most often detected at an advanced stage, only&nbsp;around one in every five people live for at least a year after being diagnosed, and just&nbsp;1 in every 20 people live&nbsp;at least a further&nbsp;five years.</p>\n<h2>Causes of liver cancer</h2>\n<div>\n<p>The exact cause of liver cancer is unknown, but many cases are linked to a problem with the liver called&nbsp;<a>cirrhosis</a>. This is where the tissue of the liver has become scarred and cannot perform many of its usual functions.</p>\n<p>Cancer is a condition&nbsp;where cells in a specific part of the body grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue known as a tumour.</p>\n<p>In cases of liver cancer, it is uncertain why and how the cells of the liver are affected, but it appears that cirrhosis can increase a person\'s chances of developing the condition.</p>\n<p>However, most cases of cirrhosis do not lead to liver cancer, and people without cirrhosis can&nbsp;also develop liver cancer.</p>\n<h2>Common causes of cirrhosis</h2>\n<p>The main causes of cirrhosis in the UK are outlined below.</p>\n<h3>Heavy and harmful drinking</h3>\n<p>The liver is a tough and resilient organ. It can endure a high level of damage that would destroy other organs and is capable of regenerating itself. But despite the liver\'s resilience, excessive alcohol intake over many years can damage it.</p>\n<p>Every time you drink alcohol, your liver filters out the poisonous alcohol from your blood and some of the liver cells die. The liver can regenerate new cells, but if you drink heavily for many years, your liver will lose the ability to do this and it can become damaged and scarred over time.</p>\n<h3>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease</h3>\n<p><a>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease</a>&nbsp;occurs when small deposits of fat build up inside the tissue of the liver.&nbsp;It\'s a&nbsp;common condition and causes no noticeable symptoms in most people.</p>\n<p>However, in some people, high levels of fat can make the liver inflamed. Over time, the inflammation&nbsp;can scar the liver.</p>\n<p>The exact cause of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is unclear, but it is associated with&nbsp;<a>obesity</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a>type 2 diabetes</a>.</p>\n<h3>Hepatitis C</h3>\n<p>A long-term infection of&nbsp;<a>hepatitis C</a>&nbsp;can cause inflammation and scarring of the liver.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hepatitis C is spread by blood contact. The most&nbsp;common ways this happens worldwide&nbsp;include poor medical practice with the use of contaminated needles, or injected drug use, where any item of injecting equipment (not just needles) is shared.</p>\n<p>If you smoke or regularly drink alcohol and have hepatitis C, your risk of developing liver cancer further increases.</p>\n<p>Early treatment of long-term hepatitis C with antiviral medication can prevent the liver from becoming scarred.</p>\n<h2>Other&nbsp;causes of cirrhosis</h2>\n<p>Less common causes of cirrhosis in the UK are described below.</p>\n<h3>Hepatitis B</h3>\n<p><a>Hepatitis B</a>&nbsp;is a virus that can be spread through contaminated blood and other types of bodily fluids, such as saliva, semen and vaginal fluids.</p>\n<p>Like hepatitis C, hepatitis B is spread through blood contact. It is most commonly spread from mother to child at birth or from child to child in early life (usually in areas outside the UK where the infection is very common), and very rarely sexually or through injecting drugs.</p>\n<p>It affects about&nbsp;1 in every 200 people&nbsp;in the UK. Most of those infected were born in&nbsp;parts of the world where the hepatitis B&nbsp;virus is very common.</p>\n<p>As with hepatitis C, hepatitis B can also cause inflammation and scarring of the liver over time.</p>\n<p>If you smoke or drink and have hepatitis B, your risk of developing liver cancer further increases.</p>\n<p>Early treatment of long-term hepatitis B with antiviral medication is not always needed, but can substantially reduce the risk of the liver becoming scarred.</p>\n<h3>Haemochromatosis</h3>\n<p>Haemochromatosis&nbsp;is a genetic condition where the body stores too much iron from food.</p>\n<p>The excess levels of iron have a poisonous effect on the liver and cause scarring over time, although treatment can reduce the risk of the condition leading to liver cancer.</p>\n<h3>Primary biliary cirrhosis</h3>\n<p>Primary biliary cirrhosis&nbsp;is a rare and poorly understood liver condition.</p>\n<p>One of the main functions of the liver is to create a&nbsp;fluid called bile, used by the body to help break down fat. The bile is transported to the digestive system via a series of tubes called bile ducts.</p>\n<p>For reasons that are unclear, in cases of primary biliary cirrhosis, the bile ducts gradually become&nbsp;damaged. This eventually leads to a build-up of bile inside the liver, which damages the liver and causes cirrhosis.</p>\n<h2>Diagnosing liver cancer</h2>\n<div>\n<p>For many people, the first stage of diagnosing liver cancer is a consultation with a GP, although people at risk are usually tested regularly for the condition.</p>\n<p>If you visit your GP, they will ask about your symptoms,&nbsp;when they started, and when they are noticeable. They will also examine you.</p>\n<p>If they feel&nbsp;you need further tests, they will refer you to a hospital specialist. Some of the tests you may have are described below.</p>\n<h2>Surveillance for liver cancer</h2>\n<p>If you are in a high-risk group for developing liver cancer, regular screening&nbsp;&ndash; known as surveillance&nbsp;&ndash; is often recommended. This is because the earlier the cancer is diagnosed, the greater the chance there is of curing it.</p>\n<p>Surveillance is usually carried out every six months and&nbsp;often involves:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a>ultrasound scans</a>&nbsp;&ndash; high-frequency sound waves are used to create an image of your liver, which can highlight any abnormalities</li>\n<li><a>blood tests</a>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;your blood is tested for a protein called&nbsp;alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), which is&nbsp;found in some people with liver cancer</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Surveillance is usually recommended if you have&nbsp;<a>cirrhosis</a>&nbsp;(scarring of the liver), although there are other factors that can also affect your risk of liver&nbsp;cancer.</p>\n<p>The potential benefits of surveillance should&nbsp;be discussed with you before&nbsp;you enter&nbsp;any screening programme.</p>\n<h2>Further testing</h2>\n<p>The tests above can also be used to look for liver cancer in people who are not being routinely screened.</p>\n<p>If these initial&nbsp;tests suggest there is a chance you could have liver cancer, one or multiple tests will usually be recommended to confirm the diagnosis.</p>\n<p>The further tests include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a>computerised tomography (CT) scans</a>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;a series of X-rays of your liver are&nbsp;taken to give&nbsp;a more detailed three-dimensional image</li>\n<li><a>magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans</a>&nbsp;&ndash; uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to build up a picture of the inside of your liver</li>\n<li><a>biopsy</a>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;a needle is inserted into your abdomen (tummy)&nbsp;to remove a small sample of liver tissue, which is then tested in a laboratory for cancerous cells</li>\n<li>laparoscopy&nbsp;&ndash; a small incision is made in your abdomen under&nbsp;<a>general anaesthetic</a>&nbsp;(where you are asleep) and a flexible camera called an endoscope is used to examine your liver</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After&nbsp;these tests have been carried out, it will usually be possible to confirm a diagnosis of liver cancer and determine the condition\'s \"stage\".</p>\n<h2>Staging liver cancer</h2>\n<p>Staging is a term used to describe how far a particular cancer has spread. There are a number of different systems used to stage liver cancer.</p>\n<p>Many liver cancer specialists use combination staging systems that include features of both the cancer and the underlying liver function to stage a person\'s condition.</p>\n<p>This is because the length of time a person lives and how well they&nbsp;tolerate potential treatments will be determined not only by how advanced their cancer is, but also by their level of health and how good their underlying liver function is.</p>\n<p>One combination system for staging liver cancer is known as the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system. The BCLC staging system consists of five stages. These are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>stage 0 &ndash;&nbsp;the tumour is less than 2cm (20mm) in diameter and the person is very well and has normal liver function</li>\n<li>stage A &ndash;&nbsp;a single tumour has grown but is less than 5cm (50mm) in diameter, or there are three or fewer smaller tumours&nbsp;less than 3cm (30mm) in diameter and the person is very well with normal liver function</li>\n<li>stage B &ndash; there are multiple tumours in the liver, but the person is well and their liver function is unaffected</li>\n<li>stage C &ndash;&nbsp;any of the above circumstances, but the person is not so well and their liver function is not so good, or where the cancer has started to spread into the main blood vessel of the liver, nearby lymph nodes or other parts of the body</li>\n<li>stage D &ndash;&nbsp;where the liver has lost most of its functioning abilities and the person begins to have symptoms of end-stage liver disease, such as a build-up of fluid inside their abdomen</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Treating liver cancer</h2>\n<div class=\"editor\">\n<p>The treatment for liver cancer depends on the stage of the condition. Treatment can include surgery and medication.</p>\n<h2>Cancer treatment teams</h2>\n<p>Most hospitals use multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) to treat liver cancer. These are teams of specialists that work together to make decisions about the best way to proceed with your treatment.</p>\n<p>Deciding which treatment is best for you can often be confusing. Your cancer team will recommend what they think is the best treatment option, but the final decision will be yours.</p>\n<h2>Your treatment plan</h2>\n<p>Your recommended treatment plan will depend on the stage your liver cancer is at (see&nbsp;<a>diagnosing liver cancer</a>&nbsp;for more information about staging).</p>\n<p>If your cancer is at stage A when diagnosed, a complete cure may be possible. The three main ways this can be achieved are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>removing the affected section of liver &ndash; known as a resection</li>\n<li>having a liver transplant &ndash; an operation to remove the liver and replace it with a healthy one</li>\n<li>using heat to kill cancerous cells &ndash; known as microwave or radiofrequency ablation (RFA)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your cancer is at stage B or C, a cure is not usually possible. However, chemotherapy can slow the progression of the cancer, relieve symptoms, and prolong life for months or, in some cases, years. There is also a medication called sorafenib that&nbsp;can help prolong life.</p>\n<p>If your cancer is at stage D when diagnosed, it is usually too late to slow down the spread of the cancer. Instead, treatment focuses on relieving&nbsp;any&nbsp;symptoms of pain and discomfort you may have.</p>\n<p>The main treatment options for liver cancer are discussed in more detail below.</p>\n<h2>Surgical resection</h2>\n<p>If damage to your liver is minimal and the cancer is contained in a small part of your liver, it may be possible to remove the cancerous cells during surgery. This procedure is known as surgical resection.</p>\n<p>As the liver can regenerate itself, it may be possible to remove a large section of it without seriously affecting your health. However, in the majority of people with liver cancer, their liver\'s regenerative ability may be significantly impaired and resection may be unsafe.</p>\n<p>Whether or not a resection can be performed is often determined by assessing the severity of your&nbsp;<a>cirrhosis</a>&nbsp;(scarring of the liver).</p>\n<p>If a liver resection is recommended, it will be carried out under a&nbsp;<a>general anaesthetic</a>, which means you will be asleep during the procedure and won\'t feel any pain as it is carried out.</p>\n<p>Most people are well enough to leave hospital within a week or two of having surgery. However, depending on how much of your liver was removed, it may take several months for you to fully recover.</p>\n<h3>Risks</h3>\n<p>Liver resection is a complicated surgery and can have a considerable impact on your body. There is a significant risk of complications occurring during and after surgery.</p>\n<p>Possible complications of liver resection include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>infection at the site of the surgery</li>\n<li>bleeding after the surgery</li>\n<li>blood clots that develop in your legs &ndash; the medical term for this is&nbsp;<a>deep vein thrombosis (DVT)</a></li>\n<li>bile leaking from the liver &ndash; further surgery may be required to stop the leak</li>\n<li>jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes)</li>\n<li>liver failure (where your liver is no longer able to function properly)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Liver resection can also sometimes cause fatal complications, such as a heart attack. It is estimated that around&nbsp;1 in every 30 people who have liver resection surgery will die during or shortly after the operation.</p>\n<h2>Liver transplant</h2>\n<p>A liver transplant involves removing a cancerous liver and replacing it with a healthy one from a donor.</p>\n<p>This is a major operation and there is a risk of potentially life-threatening complications. It\'s estimated around 1 in every 30 people will die during the procedure and up to&nbsp;1 in 10 people will die at some point in the year after surgery.</p>\n<p>A liver transplant may be suitable for you if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you only have a single tumour less than 5cm (50mm) in diameter</li>\n<li>you have three or fewer small tumours, each less than 3cm (30mm)</li>\n<li>you have responded exceptionally well to other treatments, with no evidence of tumour growth for six months</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have multiple tumours or a tumour larger than 5cm, the risk of the cancer returning is usually so high that a liver transplant will be of no benefit.</p>\n<p>If you are suitable for a liver transplant, you will normally need to be placed on a waiting list until a donor liver becomes available. The average waiting time for a liver transplant is 142 days for adults.</p>\n<p>In some cases, a small part of the liver of a living relative can be used. This is known as a living donor liver transplant.</p>\n<p>The advantage of using a living donor liver transplant is that the person receiving the transplant can plan the procedure with their medical team and relative, and will not usually have to wait very long.</p>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;<a>liver transplants</a>.</p>\n<h2>Microwave or radiofrequency ablation</h2>\n<p>Microwave or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) may be recommended as an alternative to surgery to treat liver cancer at an early stage, ideally when the tumour or tumours are smaller than 5cm (50mm) in diameter.</p>\n<p>They can also be used to treat tumours larger than this, but the treatment may need to be repeated in such cases.</p>\n<p>These treatments involve heating the tumours with microwaves or radio waves produced by small, needle-like electrodes. This heat kills the cancer cells and causes the tumours to shrink.</p>\n<p>Similar procedures using lasers or freezing can also achieve the same result.</p>\n<p>There are three main ways microwave ablation or RFA can be carried out:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>where the needles are passed through the skin (percutaneously)</li>\n<li>where the needles are inserted through small incisions in your abdomen&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;\"keyhole\" surgery (laparoscopy)</li>\n<li>where the needles are inserted through a single large incision made in your abdomen&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;\"open\" surgery</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Continuous&nbsp;<a>ultrasound</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>computerised tomography (CT) scans</a>&nbsp;are used to make sure the needles are guided into the correct position.</p>\n<p>Microwave ablation or RFA can be carried out under general anaesthetic or&nbsp;<a>local anaesthetic</a>&nbsp;(where you are awake but the area being treated is numbed), depending on the technique used and the size of the area being treated.</p>\n<p>How long it takes to carry out the treatment depends on the size and number of tumours being treated, but it usually takes between one and three hours in total. Most people need to stay overnight in hospital.</p>\n<p>You may experience some minor discomfort and&nbsp;<a>flu</a>-like symptoms, such as chills and muscle pains, for a few days after the procedure.</p>\n<p>The risk of complications occurring with microwave ablation or RFA is low, but possible problems can include bleeding, infection, minor burns and damage to nearby organs.</p>\n<h2>Chemotherapy</h2>\n<p>Chemotherapy&nbsp;uses powerful cancer-killing medications to slow the spread of liver cancer.</p>\n<p>A type of chemotherapy called transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) is usually recommended to treat cases of stage B and C liver cancer. In these cases, the treatment can prolong life, but cannot cure the cancer.</p>\n<p>TACE may also be used to help prevent cancer spreading out of the liver in people waiting for a liver transplant.</p>\n<p>It&nbsp;is not recommended for stage D liver cancer because it can make the symptoms of liver disease worse.</p>\n<h3>TACE procedure</h3>\n<p>During TACE a fine tube called a catheter is inserted&nbsp;into the main blood vessel in your groin (femoral artery) and passed along the artery&nbsp;to the main blood vessel that carries blood to the liver (hepatic artery).</p>\n<p>Chemotherapy medication is injected directly into the liver through the catheter and either a gel or small plastic beads are injected into the blood vessels supplying the tumours to help slow down the speed they grow.</p>\n<p>TACE usually takes one to two hours to complete. After the procedure, you will stay in hospital overnight before returning home.</p>\n<p>This procedure can be completed several times if necessary.</p>\n<h3>Side effects</h3>\n<p>Injecting chemotherapy medications directly into the liver, rather than into the blood, has the advantage of avoiding the wide range of side effects associated with conventional chemotherapy, such as hair loss and tiredness.</p>\n<p>However, the procedure is not free of side effects and complications. The most common side effect is post-chemoembolisation syndrome, which can cause abdominal (tummy) pain and a high temperature (fever), as well as making you vomit or feel sick.</p>\n<p>These symptoms may last for a few weeks after a TACE session.</p>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;<a>chemotherapy</a>.</p>\n<h2>Alcohol injections</h2>\n<p>If you only have a few small tumours, alcohol (ethanol) injections may be used as a treatment.&nbsp;A needle passes through the skin to inject alcohol into the cancerous cells. This dehydrates the cells and stops their blood supply.</p>\n<p>In most cases, this is carried out under a local anaesthetic, meaning you will be awake, but the affected area is numbed so you won\'t feel any pain.</p>\n<h2>Sorafenib</h2>\n<p>Sorafenib is a medication given in tablet form that can disrupt the blood supply to liver tumours and slow down their growth.</p>\n<p>It is sometimes used as a treatment for advanced cases of liver cancer, although it is not routinely available on the NHS because the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has said the cost of the medication is high for the limited benefit it offers.</p>\n<p>Whether or not you are eligible for sorafenib will be decided by your medical team, and will depend on the likelihood of whether&nbsp;you will significantly benefit from the medication.</p>\n<p>For more information, see the&nbsp;<a>NICE guidelines on sorafenib for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma</a>.</p>\n<h2>Advanced liver cancer</h2>\n<p>Treatment for advanced liver cancer focuses on relieving symptoms such as pain and discomfort, rather than attempting to slow down the progression of the cancer.</p>\n<p>Some people with advanced liver cancer require strong painkillers, such as codeine or possibly morphine. Nausea and constipation are common side effects of these types of painkillers, so you may also be given an anti-sickness tablet and a laxative.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(132,131,NULL,NULL,'<h1>Lung cancer:</h1>\n<h2>Symptoms of lung cancer</h2>\n<div >\n<p>Symptoms of lung cancer develop as the condition progresses and there are usually no signs or symptoms in the early stages.</p>\n<p>The main symptoms of lung cancer are listed below. If you have any of these, you should see your GP:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a&nbsp;<a>cough</a>&nbsp;that doesn&rsquo;t go away after two or three weeks</li>\n<li>a long-standing cough that&nbsp;gets worse</li>\n<li>persistent&nbsp;<a>chest infections</a></li>\n<li>coughing up blood</li>\n<li>an ache or pain when breathing or coughing</li>\n<li>persistent&nbsp;<a>breathlessness</a></li>\n<li>persistent tiredness or lack of energy</li>\n<li>loss of appetite or unexplained weight loss</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Less common symptoms of lung cancer include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>changes in the appearance of your fingers, such as becoming more curved or their ends becoming larger (this is known as finger clubbing)</li>\n<li>a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above&nbsp;</li>\n<li><a >difficulty swallowing</a>&nbsp;or pain when swallowing</li>\n<li>wheezing</li>\n<li>a hoarse voice&nbsp;</li>\n<li>swelling of your face or neck</li>\n<li>persistent chest or shoulder pain</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Causes of lung cancer</h2>\n<div class=\"editor\">\n<p>Most cases of lung cancer are caused by smoking, although people who have never smoked can also develop the condition.</p>\n<h2>Smoking</h2>\n<p>Smoking cigarettes is the single biggest risk factor for lung cancer.&nbsp;It\'s responsible for more than 85% of all cases.</p>\n<p>Tobacco smoke contains more than 60 different toxic substances, which can&nbsp;lead to&nbsp;the development of cancer. These substances are known to be carcinogenic (cancer-producing).</p>\n<p>If you smoke more than 25 cigarettes a day, you are 25 times more likely to get lung cancer than a non-smoker.</p>\n<p>While smoking cigarettes is the biggest risk factor, using other types of tobacco products can also increase your risk of developing lung cancer and other types of cancer, such as&nbsp;<a >oesophageal cancer</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a >mouth cancer</a>. These products include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>cigars</li>\n<li>pipe tobacco</li>\n<li>snuff (a powdered form of tobacco)</li>\n<li>chewing tobacco</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Smoking cannabis has also been linked to an increased risk of lung cancer. Most cannabis smokers mix their cannabis with tobacco.&nbsp;While they tend to smoke less than tobacco smokers, they usually inhale more deeply and hold the smoke in their lungs for longer.</p>\n<p>It\'s been&nbsp;estimated that smoking four joints (homemade cigarettes mixed with cannabis) may be as damaging to the lungs as smoking 20 cigarettes.</p>\n<p>Even smoking cannabis without mixing it with tobacco is potentially dangerous. This is because cannabis also contains substances that can cause cancer.</p>\n<h2>Passive smoking</h2>\n<p>If you don\'t smoke, frequent exposure to other people&rsquo;s tobacco smoke (passive smoking) can increase your risk of developing lung cancer.</p>\n<p>For example, research has found that non-smoking women who share their house with a smoking partner are 25% more likely to develop lung cancer than non-smoking women who live with a non-smoking partner.</p>\n<h2>Radon</h2>\n<p>Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that&nbsp;comes from tiny amounts of uranium present in all rocks and soils. It can sometimes be found in buildings.</p>\n<p>If radon is breathed in, it can damage your lungs, particularly if you\'re a smoker. Radon is estimated to be responsible for about 3% of all lung cancer deaths in England.</p>\n<h2>Occupational exposure and pollution</h2>\n<p>Exposure to certain chemicals and substances used in several occupations and industries has been linked to a slightly higher risk of developing lung cancer. These chemicals and substances include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>arsenic</li>\n<li>asbestos</li>\n<li>beryllium</li>\n<li>cadmium</li>\n<li>coal and coke fumes</li>\n<li>silica</li>\n<li>nickel</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read more information about&nbsp;<a >asbestosis</a>&nbsp;and silicosis.</p>\n<p>Research&nbsp;also suggests that being exposed to large amounts of diesel fumes for many years may increase your risk of developing lung cancer by up to 50%. One study has shown that your risk of developing lung cancer increases by about a third if you live in an area with high levels of nitrogen oxide gases (mostly produced by cars and other vehicles).</p>\n<h2>Diagnosing lung cancer</h2>\n<div>\n<p>See your GP if you have&nbsp;<a>symptoms of lung cancer</a>, such as breathlessness or a persistent cough.</p>\n<p>Your GP will ask about your general health and what symptoms you\'ve been experiencing. They may examine you and ask you to breathe into a device called a spirometer, which measures how much air you breathe in and out.</p>\n<p>You may be asked to have a&nbsp;<a>blood test</a>&nbsp;to rule out some of the possible causes of your symptoms, such as a&nbsp;<a>chest infection</a>.</p>\n<p>In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published&nbsp;<a>guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of lung cancer</a>&nbsp;and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected lung cancer.</p>\n<h2>Chest X-ray</h2>\n<p>A chest&nbsp;<a>X-ray</a>&nbsp;is usually the first test used to diagnose lung cancer. Most lung tumours show up on X-rays as a white-grey mass.</p>\n<p>However, chest X-rays can\'t give a definitive diagnosis because they often can\'t distinguish between cancer and other conditions, such as a lung abscess (a collection of pus that forms in the lungs).</p>\n<p>If your chest X-ray suggests you may have lung cancer, you should be referred to a specialist (if you haven\'t already) in chest conditions such as lung cancer. A specialist can carry out more tests to investigate whether you have lung cancer and, if you do,&nbsp;what type it is&nbsp;and how much it\'s spread.</p>\n<h2>CT scan</h2>\n<p>A&nbsp;<a>computerised tomography (CT) scan</a>&nbsp;is usually carried out after a chest X-ray. A CT scan&nbsp;uses X-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the inside of your body.</p>\n<p>Before having a CT scan, you\'ll be given an injection of a contrast medium. This is a liquid containing a dye that makes the lungs show up more clearly on the scan. The scan is painless and takes 10-30 minutes to complete.</p>\n<h2>PET-CT scan</h2>\n<p>A PET-CT scan (which stands for&nbsp;<a>positron emission tomography</a>-computerised tomography) may be carried out if the results of the CT scan show you have cancer at an early stage.</p>\n<p>The PET-CT scan can show where there are active cancer cells. This can help with diagnosis and treatment.</p>\n<p>Before having a PET-CT scan, you\'ll be injected with a slightly radioactive material. You\'ll be asked to lie down on a table, which slides into the PET scanner. The scan is painless and takes around 30-60 minutes.</p>\n<h2>Bronchoscopy and biopsy</h2>\n<p>If the CT scan shows there might be cancer in the central part of your chest, you\'ll have a bronchoscopy. A bronchoscopy is a procedure&nbsp;that allows&nbsp;a doctor or nurse to&nbsp;remove a small sample of cells from inside your lungs.</p>\n<p>During a bronchoscopy, a thin tube called a bronchoscope is used to examine your lungs and take a sample of cells (<a>biopsy</a>). The bronchoscope is passed through your mouth or nose, down your throat and into the airways of your lungs.</p>\n<p>The procedure may be uncomfortable, but you\'ll be given a mild sedative beforehand to help you relax and a&nbsp;<a>local anaesthetic</a>&nbsp;to make your throat numb. The procedure is very quick and only takes a few minutes.</p>\n<h2>Other types of biopsy</h2>\n<p>If you\'re not able to have one of the biopsies described above, or you\'ve had one and the results weren\'t clear, you may be offered a different type of biopsy. This may be a type of surgical biopsy such as a thoracoscopy or a mediastinoscopy, or a biopsy carried out using a needle inserted through your skin.</p>\n<p>These types of biopsy are described below.</p>\n<h3>Percutaneous needle biopsy</h3>\n<p>A percutaneous needle biopsy involves removing a sample from a suspected tumour to test it at a laboratory for cancerous cells.</p>\n<p>The doctor carrying out the biopsy will use a CT scanner to guide a needle to the site of a suspected tumour through the skin. A local anaesthetic is used to numb the surrounding skin, and the needle is passed through your skin and into your lungs. The needle will then be used to remove a sample of tissue for testing.</p>\n<h3>Thoracoscopy</h3>\n<p>A thoracoscopy is a procedure that allows the doctor to examine a particular area of your chest and take tissue and fluid samples.</p>\n<p>You\'re likely to need a&nbsp;<a>general anaesthetic</a>&nbsp;before having a thoracoscopy. Two or three small cuts will be made in your chest to pass a tube (similar to a bronchoscope) into your chest. The doctor will use the tube to look inside your chest and take samples. The samples will then be sent away for tests.</p>\n<p>After a thoracoscopy, you may need to stay in hospital overnight while any further fluid in your lungs is drained out.</p>\n<h3>Mediastinoscopy</h3>\n<p>A mediastinoscopy allows the doctor to examine the area between your lungs at the centre of your chest (mediastinum).</p>\n<p>For this test, you\'ll need to have a general anaesthetic and stay in hospital for a couple of days. The doctor will make a small cut at the bottom of your neck so they can pass a thin tube into your chest.</p>\n<p>The tube has a camera at the end, which enables the doctor to see inside your chest. They\'ll also be able to take samples of your cells and lymph nodes at the same time. The lymph nodes are tested because they\'re usually the first place that lung cancer spreads to.</p>\n<h2>Staging</h2>\n<p>Once the above tests have been completed, it should be possible to work out what stage your cancer is, what this means&nbsp;for your treatment and whether it\'s possible to&nbsp;completely cure the cancer.</p>\n<h3>Non-small-cell lung cancer</h3>\n<p>Non-small-cell lung cancer (the most common type)&nbsp;usually spreads more slowly than small-cell lung cancer and responds differently to treatment.</p>\n<p>The stages of non-small-cell lung cancer&nbsp;are outlined below.</p>\n<p>Stage 1</p>\n<p>The cancer is contained within the lung and hasn\'t spread to nearby lymph nodes. Stage 1 can also be divided into two sub-stages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>stage 1A &ndash; the tumour is less than 3cm in size (1.2 inches)&nbsp;</li>\n<li>stage 1B &ndash; the tumour is 3-5cm (1.2-2 inches)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Stage 2</p>\n<p>Stage 2 is divided into two sub-stages: 2A and 2B.</p>\n<p>In stage 2A lung cancer, either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the tumour is 5-7cm&nbsp;</li>\n<li>the tumour is less than 5cm&nbsp;and cancerous cells have spread to nearby lymph nodes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In stage 2B lung cancer, either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the tumour is larger than 7cm&nbsp;</li>\n<li>the tumour is 5-7cm and cancerous cells have spread to nearby lymph nodes&nbsp;</li>\n<li>the cancer hasn\'t spread to lymph nodes, but has spread to surrounding&nbsp;muscles or tissue&nbsp;</li>\n<li>the cancer has spread to one of the main airways (bronchus)&nbsp;</li>\n<li>the cancer has caused the lung to collapse&nbsp;</li>\n<li>there are multiple small tumours in the lung</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Stage 3</p>\n<p>Stage 3 is divided into two sub-stages: 3A and 3B.</p>\n<p>In stage 3A lung cancer, the cancer has either spread to the lymph nodes in the middle of the chest or into the surrounding tissue. This can be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the covering of the lung (the pleura)</li>\n<li>the chest wall</li>\n<li>the middle of the chest</li>\n<li>other lymph nodes near the affected lung</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In stage 3B lung cancer, the cancer has spread to either of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>lymph nodes on either side of the chest, above the collarbones</li>\n<li>another important part of the body, such as the gullet (oesophagus), windpipe (trachea), heart or into a main blood vessel</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Stage 4</p>\n<p>In stage 4 lung cancer, the cancer has either spread to both lungs or to another part of the body (such as the bones, liver or brain), or the cancer has caused fluid-containing cancer cells to build up around your heart or lungs.</p>\n<h3>Small-cell lung cancer</h3>\n<p>Small-cell lung cancer is less common than non-small-cell lung cancer. The cancerous cells responsible for the condition are smaller in size when examined under a microscope than the cells that cause non-small-cell lung cancer.</p>\n<p>Small-cell lung cancer only&nbsp;has two possible stages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>limited disease &ndash; the cancer has not spread beyond the lung</li>\n<li>extensive disease &ndash; the cancer has spread beyond the lung</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Treating lung cancer</h2>\n<div class=\"editor\">\n<p>Treatment for lung cancer is carried out by a team of specialists who will work together to provide the best possible treatment.</p>\n<p>This team contains all the specialists required to make a proper diagnosis, to stage your cancer and to plan the best treatment. If you want to know more, ask your specialist about this.</p>\n<p>The type of treatment you\'ll receive for lung cancer depends on several factors, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the type of lung cancer you have (non-small-cell or small-cell cancer)</li>\n<li>the size and position of the cancer</li>\n<li>how far advanced your cancer is (the stage)</li>\n<li>your overall health</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Deciding what treatment is best for you can be difficult. Your cancer team will make recommendations, but the final decision will be yours.</p>\n<p>The main treatment options include surgery,&nbsp;<a>radiotherapy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a>chemotherapy</a>. Depending on your type of cancer and how advanced it is, you may receive a combination of these treatments.</p>\n<h2>Your treatment plan</h2>\n<p>Your treatment plan depends on whether you have non-small-cell lung cancer or small-cell lung cancer.</p>\n<h3>Non-small-cell lung cancer</h3>\n<p>If you have non-small-cell lung cancer that\'s confined to one lung and you\'re in good general health, you\'ll probably have surgery to remove the cancerous cells. This may be followed by a course of chemotherapy to destroy any cancer cells that may have remained in the body.</p>\n<p>If the cancer hasn\'t spread too far but surgery isn\'t possible (for example, if your general health means you have an increased risk of developing complications), radiotherapy to destroy the cancerous cells will usually be recommended. In some cases, this may be combined with chemotherapy (known as chemoradiotherapy).</p>\n<p>If the cancer has spread too far for surgery or radiotherapy to be effective, chemotherapy is usually recommended. If the cancer starts to grow again after initial chemotherapy treatment, another course of treatment may be recommended.</p>\n<p>In some cases, a treatment called biological or targeted therapy may be recommended as an alternative to chemotherapy, or after chemotherapy. Biological therapies are medications that can control or stop the growth of cancer cells.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Small-cell lung cancer</h3>\n<p>Small-cell lung cancer is usually treated with chemotherapy, either on its own or in combination with radiotherapy. This can help to prolong life and relieve symptoms.</p>\n<p>Surgery isn\'t usually used to treat this type of lung cancer. This is&nbsp;because the cancer has often already spread to other areas of the body by the time it\'s diagnosed. However, if the cancer is found very early, surgery may be used. In these cases, chemotherapy or radiotherapy may be given after surgery to help reduce the risk of the cancer returning.</p>\n<h2>Surgery</h2>\n<p>There are three types of lung cancer surgery:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lobectomy &ndash;&nbsp;where&nbsp;one&nbsp;or more large parts of the lung (called lobes) are removed. Your doctors will suggest this operation if the cancer is just in one section of one lung.</li>\n<li>Pneumonectomy &ndash; where the entire lung is removed. This is used when the cancer is located in the middle of the lung or has spread throughout the lung.</li>\n<li>Wedge resection or segmentectomy &ndash; where a small piece of the lung is removed. This procedure is&nbsp;only suitable for a small number of patients, as it is only used if your doctors think your cancer is small and limited to one area of the lung. This is&nbsp;usually very early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>People are naturally concerned that they won\'t&nbsp;be able to breathe if some or all of a lung is removed, but it\'s possible to breathe normally with one lung. However, if you have breathing problems before the operation, such as breathlessness, it\'s likely that these symptoms will continue after surgery.</p>\n<h3>Tests before surgery</h3>\n<p>Before surgery can take place, you\'ll need to have a number of tests to check your general state of health and your lung function. These may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>an&nbsp;<a>electrocardiogram (ECG)</a>&nbsp;&ndash; electrodes are used to monitor the electrical activity of your heart</li>\n<li>spirometry&nbsp;&ndash; you\'ll breathe into a machine called a spirometer, which measures how much air your lungs can breathe in and out</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How it\'s performed</h3>\n<p>Surgery is usually performed by making a cut (incision)&nbsp;in your chest or side, and removing a section or all of the affected lung. Nearby lymph nodes may also be removed if it\'s thought that the cancer may have spread to them.</p>\n<p>In some cases, an alternative to this approach, called video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), may be suitable. VATS is a type of keyhole surgery, where small incisions are made in the chest. A small fibre-optic camera is inserted into one of the incisions, so the surgeon can see images of the inside of your chest&nbsp;on a monitor.</p>\n<h3>After the operation</h3>\n<p>You\'ll probably be&nbsp;able to go home 5 to 10 days after your operation. However, it can take many weeks to recover fully from a lung operation.</p>\n<p>After your operation, you\'ll be encouraged to start moving about as soon as possible. Even if you have to stay in bed, you\'ll need to keep doing regular leg movements to help your circulation and prevent blood clots from forming. A physiotherapist will show you breathing exercises to help prevent complications.</p>\n<p>When you go home, you\'ll need to exercise gently to build up your strength and fitness. Walking and swimming are good forms of exercise that are suitable for most people after treatment for lung cancer. Talk to your care team about which types of exercise are suitable for you.</p>\n<h3>Complications</h3>\n<p>As with all surgery, lung surgery carries a risk of complications. These are estimated to occur in one out in five cases. These complications can usually be treated using medication or additional surgery, which may mean you need to stay in hospital for longer.</p>\n<p>Complications of lung surgery can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>inflammation or infection of the lung (<a>pneumonia</a>)&nbsp;</li>\n<li>excessive bleeding&nbsp;</li>\n<li>a blood clot in the leg (<a>deep vein thrombosis</a>), which could potentially travel up to the lung (pulmonary embolism)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Radiotherapy</h2>\n<p>Radiotherapy is a type of treatment that uses pulses of radiation to destroy cancer cells. There are a number of ways it can be used to treat people with lung cancer.</p>\n<p>An intensive course of radiotherapy, known as radical radiotherapy, can be used to try to cure non-small-cell lung cancer if the person isn\'t healthy enough for surgery. For very small tumours, a special type of radiotherapy called stereotactic radiotherapy may be used instead of surgery.</p>\n<p>Radiotherapy can also be used to control the symptoms and slow the spread of cancer when a cure isn\'t possible (this is known as palliative radiotherapy).</p>\n<p>A type of radiotherapy known as prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is also sometimes used during the treatment of small-cell lung cancer. PCI involves treating the whole brain with a low dose of radiation. It\'s used as a preventative measure because there\'s a risk that small-cell lung cancer will spread to your brain.</p>\n<p>The three main&nbsp;ways that radiotherapy can be given are described below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Conventional external beam radiotherapy &ndash; a machine is used to direct beams of radiation at affected parts of your body.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Stereotactic radiotherapy &ndash; a more accurate type of external beam radiotherapy where several high-energy beams are used to deliver a higher dose of radiation to the tumour, while sparing the surrounding healthy tissue as much as possible.</li>\n<li>Internal radiotherapy &ndash; a catheter (thin tube) is inserted into your lung. A small piece of radioactive material is placed inside the catheter and positioned against the site of the tumour before being removed after a few minutes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For lung cancer, external beam radiotherapy is used more often than internal radiotherapy, particularly if it\'s thought that a cure is possible. Stereotactic radiotherapy may be used to treat tumours that are very small, as it\'s more effective than standard radiotherapy alone in these circumstances.</p>\n<p>Internal radiotherapy only tends to be used as a palliative treatment when the cancer is blocking or partly blocking your airway.</p>\n<h3>Courses of treatment</h3>\n<p>A course of radiotherapy treatment can be planned in several different ways.</p>\n<p>Radical radiotherapy is usually given five days a week, with a break at weekends. Each session of radiotherapy lasts 10-15 minutes and the course usually lasts four to seven weeks.</p>\n<p>Continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (CHART) is an alternative method of delivering radical radiotherapy. CHART is given three times a day for 12 days in a row.</p>\n<p>For stereotactic radiotherapy, fewer treatment sessions are needed because a higher dose of radiation is delivered with each treatment. People having conventional radical radiotherapy are likely to have around 20-32 treatment sessions, whereas stereotactic radiotherapy typically only requires anything from 3 to 10 sessions.</p>\n<p>Palliative radiotherapy usually only requires one to five sessions to control your symptoms.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Side effects</h3>\n<p>Side effects of radiotherapy to the chest&nbsp;include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a>chest pain</a>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>fatigue&nbsp;</li>\n<li>persistent&nbsp;<a>cough</a>&nbsp;that may bring up blood-stained phlegm (this is normal and nothing to worry about)&nbsp;</li>\n<li><a>difficulties swallowing (dysphagia)</a>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>redness and soreness of the skin, which looks and feels like sunburn&nbsp;</li>\n<li>hair loss&nbsp;on your chest&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Side effects should pass once the course of radiotherapy has been completed.</p>\n<h2>Chemotherapy</h2>\n<p>Chemotherapy uses powerful cancer-killing medication to treat cancer. There are several different ways that chemotherapy can be used to treat lung cancer. For example, it can be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>given before surgery to shrink a tumour, which can increase the chance of successful surgery&nbsp;(this is usually only done as part of a clinical trial)</li>\n<li>given after surgery to prevent the cancer returning&nbsp;</li>\n<li>used to relieve symptoms and slow the spread of cancer when a cure isn\'t possible</li>\n<li>combined with radiotherapy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chemotherapy treatments are usually given in cycles. A cycle involves taking the chemotherapy medication for several days, then having a break for a few weeks to let your body recover from the effects of the treatment.</p>\n<p>The number of cycles of chemotherapy you need will depend on the type and the grade of your lung cancer. Most people require four to six courses of treatment over three to six months.</p>\n<p>Chemotherapy for lung cancer involves taking a combination of different medications. The medications are usually delivered through a drip into a vein (intravenously), or into a tube connected to one of the blood vessels in your chest. Some people may be given capsules or tablets to swallow instead.</p>\n<h3>Side effects</h3>\n<p>Side effects of chemotherapy can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>fatigue&nbsp;</li>\n<li>nausea</li>\n<li>vomiting&nbsp;</li>\n<li>mouth ulcers</li>\n<li>hair loss</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These side effects should gradually pass once your treatment has finished, or you may be able to take other medicines to make you feel better during your chemotherapy.</p>\n<p>Chemotherapy can also weaken your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection.&nbsp;Tell your care team or GP as soon as possible if you have possible signs of an infection, such as a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or more, or you suddenly feel generally unwell.</p>\n<h2>Other treatments</h2>\n<p>As well as surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, there are a number of other treatments that are sometimes used to treat lung cancer. These are described below.</p>\n<h3>Biological therapies</h3>\n<p>Biological therapies&nbsp;are newer medications. They\'re sometimes recommended as an alternative treatment to chemotherapy for non-small-cell cancer that has spread too far for surgery or radiotherapy to be effective.</p>\n<p>Examples of biological therapies include&nbsp;erlotinib and gefitinib. These are also called&nbsp;growth factor inhibitors because they work by disrupting the growth of the cancer cells.</p>\n<p>Biological therapies are only suitable for people who have&nbsp;certain proteins&nbsp;in their cancerous cells. Your doctor may be able to request tests on&nbsp;a small&nbsp;sample of cells removed from your lung (biopsy) to determine whether these treatments&nbsp;are likely to be suitable for you.</p>\n<h3>Radiofrequency ablation</h3>\n<p>Radiofrequency ablation is a new type of treatment that can treat non-small-cell lung cancer diagnosed at an early stage.</p>\n<p>The doctor carrying out the treatment uses a&nbsp;<a>computerised tomography (CT) scanner</a>&nbsp;to guide a needle to the site of the tumour. The needle will be pressed into the tumour and radio waves will be sent through the needle. These waves generate heat, which kills the cancer cells.</p>\n<p>The most common complication of radiofrequency ablation is that a pocket of air gets trapped between the inner and outer layer of your lungs (pneumothorax). This can be treated by placing a tube into the lungs to drain away the trapped air.</p>\n<h3>Cryotherapy</h3>\n<p>Cryotherapy is a treatment that can be used if the cancer starts to block your airways. This is known as endobronchial obstruction, and it can cause symptoms such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>breathing problems</li>\n<li>a cough</li>\n<li>coughing up blood</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cryotherapy is performed in a similar way to internal radiotherapy, except that instead of using a radioactive source, a device known as a cryoprobe is placed against the tumour. The cryoprobe can generate very cold temperatures, which help to shrink the tumour.</p>\n<h3>Photodynamic therapy</h3>\n<p>Photodynamic therapy (PDT)&nbsp;is a treatment that can be used to treat early-stage lung cancer when a person is unable or unwilling to have surgery. It can also be used to remove a tumour that\'s blocking the airways.</p>\n<p>Photodynamic therapy is carried out in two stages. Firstly, you\'ll be given an injection of a medication that makes the cells in your body very sensitive to light.</p>\n<p>The next stage is carried out 24-72 hours later. A thin tube&nbsp;will be guided to the site of the tumour, and a laser will be beamed through it. The cancerous cells, which are now more sensitive to light, will be destroyed by the laser beam.</p>\n<p>Side effects of photodynamic therapy can include inflammation of the airways&nbsp;and a build-up of fluid in the lungs. Both these side effects can cause symptoms of breathlessness and lung and throat pain. However, these symptoms should gradually pass as your lungs recover from the effects of the treatment.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(133,132,NULL,NULL,'<h1>Mouth cancer:</h1>\n<h2>Symptoms of mouth cancer</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Mouth cancer can develop on most parts of the mouth, including the lips, gums and occasionally, the throat.</p>\n<p>The most common symptoms of mouth cancer include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>red or white patches in the mouth or throat</li>\n<li>a lump</li>\n<li><a>ulcers</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other symptoms may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>persistent pain in the mouth</li>\n<li>pain or difficulty when swallowing (<a>dysphagia</a>)</li>\n<li>changes in your voice, or speech problems</li>\n<li>swollen lymph nodes (glands) in your neck</li>\n<li>unexplained weight loss</li>\n<li>bleeding or numbness in the mouth</li>\n<li>a tooth, or teeth, that becomes loose for no obvious reason</li>\n<li>difficulty moving your jaw</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>When to seek medical advice</h2>\n<p>Many of the symptoms listed above can&nbsp;be caused by less serious conditions, such as minor infections.</p>\n<p>But it\'s strongly recommended that you visit your GP if any of the symptoms listed above have lasted for more than three weeks. It\'s especially important to seek medical advice if you\'re a heavy drinker or smoker.</p>\n<h2>Dental check-ups</h2>\n<p>Mouth cancer tends not to cause any noticeable symptoms during the initial stages of the disease.</p>\n<p>This is why it is important to have regular dental check-ups, particularly if you are a smoker, a heavy drinker or a betel chewer, because a dentist may often be able to detect the condition during an examination.</p>\n<h2>Causes of mouth cancer</h2>\n<div>\n<p>The two leading causes of mouth cancer in the UK are drinking too much alcohol and smoking.</p>\n<p>Both alcohol and tobacco are carcinogenic, which means they contain chemicals that can damage the DNA in cells and lead to&nbsp;<a>cancer</a>.</p>\n<p>The risk of mouth cancer increases significantly in somebody who is both a heavy smoker and heavy drinker.</p>\n<p>Exactly what triggers the changes in DNA that lead to mouth cancer and why only a small number of people develop mouth cancer is still uncertain.</p>\n<h2>How mouth cancer spreads</h2>\n<p>There are two ways mouth cancer can spread:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>directly &ndash; the cancer can spread out of the mouth and into nearby tissues, such as surrounding skin or into the back of the jaw</li>\n<li>via the lymphatic system &ndash;&nbsp;the lymphatic system is a series of glands&nbsp;found throughout your body which&nbsp;produce many specialised cells needed by your immune system to fight infection</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mouth cancer that spreads to another part of the body is known as metastatic oral cancer.</p>\n<h2>Other risk factors</h2>\n<p>Other&nbsp;risk factors for mouth cancer may&nbsp;include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>chewing tobacco or other smokeless tobacco products like snus</li>\n<li>chewing&nbsp;betel nuts with or without tobacco</li>\n<li>a poor diet</li>\n<li>the human papilloma virus (HPV)</li>\n<li>poor oral hygiene</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Smokeless tobacco</h3>\n<p>There is a range of smokeless tobacco products including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>chewing tobacco</li>\n<li>snuff &ndash; powdered tobacco designed to be snorted</li>\n<li>snus &ndash; a type of smokeless tobacco popular in Sweden, which is placed under your upper lip</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Smokeless tobacco products are not harmless and may increase your risk of developing mouth cancer, as well as other cancers, such as liver cancer, pancreatic cancer and oesophageal cancer.</p>\n<h3>Betel nuts</h3>\n<p>Betel nuts are mildly addictive seeds taken from the betel palm tree, and are widely used in many southeast Asian ethnic communities, such as people of Indian and Sri Lankan origin.</p>\n<p>They have a stimulant effect similar to coffee. Betel nuts also have a carcinogenic effect, which can increase the risk of mouth cancer. This risk is made worse as many people enjoy chewing betel nuts along with tobacco.</p>\n<p>Due to the tradition of using betel nuts, rates of mouth cancer are much higher in ethnic Indian and Sri Lankan communities than in the population at large.</p>\n<h3>Diet</h3>\n<p>There is evidence that a poor diet may increase your risk of some types of mouth cancer.</p>\n<p>A healthy, balanced diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables is thought to reduce your risk of developing mouth cancer.</p>\n<h3>Human papilloma virus (HPV)</h3>\n<p>The human papilloma virus (HPV) is a family of viruses that affect the skin and&nbsp;moist membranes that line your body, such as those in your cervix, anus, mouth and throat.</p>\n<p>You can contract an HPV infection by having sexual contact with a person already infected &ndash; you do not have to have \'full sex\'; just close skin-to-skin contact.</p>\n<p>There is evidence that in rare cases,&nbsp;certain types of HPV can cause abnormal tissue growth inside the mouth, triggering mouth cancer.</p>\n<h3>Poor oral hygiene</h3>\n<p>There is evidence that poor oral hygiene, such as having&nbsp;<a>tooth decay</a>,&nbsp;<a>gum disease</a>, not brushing your teeth regularly and having ill-fitted dentures (false teeth) can increase your risk of mouth cancer.</p>\n<h2>Diagnosing mouth cancer</h2>\n<div>\n<p>If you have symptoms of mouth cancer, your GP will carry out a physical examination and ask about your symptoms.</p>\n<p>If mouth cancer is suspected, you will be referred to hospital for further tests or to speak to a specialist head and neck surgeon.</p>\n<p>In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of mouth cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected mouth cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on&nbsp;<a>Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral</a>.</p>\n<h2>Biopsy</h2>\n<p>It may be necessary to remove a small sample of affected tissue to check for the presence of cancerous cells. This procedure is known as a&nbsp;<a>biopsy</a>.</p>\n<p>There are three main methods used to carry out a biopsy in cases of suspected mouth cancer.</p>\n<h3>Punch biopsy</h3>\n<p>A punch biopsy may be used if the suspected affected area of tissue is in an easily accessible place, such as your tongue or the inside of your mouth.</p>\n<p>The area is first injected with a local anaesthetic to numb it. The doctor will then cut away a small section of affected tissue and remove it with tweezers.</p>\n<p>The procedure is not painful, but can feel a little uncomfortable.</p>\n<h3>Fine needle aspiration (FNA)</h3>\n<p>A fine needle aspiration (FNA) is a type of biopsy used if it is suspected&nbsp;a swelling in your neck is the result of mouth cancer.</p>\n<p>Your neck is numbed and a&nbsp;needle is used&nbsp;to draw out a small sample of tissue and fluids from the lump. The sample is then&nbsp;checked for cancerous cells.</p>\n<p>FNA is not painful but&nbsp;it can be uncomfortable and cause bruising.</p>\n<h3>Panendoscopy</h3>\n<p>A&nbsp;panendoscope is used if the suspected tissue is at the back of your throat or inside one of your nasal cavities.</p>\n<p>This is a long thin tube&nbsp;with a&nbsp;camera and a light&nbsp;which&nbsp;is guided through&nbsp;the nose, then used to remove a small section of tissue for the biopsy.</p>\n<p>The panendoscope can also check whether cancer has spread from your mouth to further down your throat, such as your larynx (voice box), oesophagus (gullet) or trachea (windpipe).</p>\n<h2>Further tests</h2>\n<p>If the biopsy confirms cancer you will need further tests to check what stage it has reached.</p>\n<p>If the cancer is diagnosed late it can have spread from your mouth into the lymphatic system &ndash; a series of glands throughout your body which produce many of the specialised cells needed by your immune system.</p>\n<p>Once the cancer reaches the lymphatic system, it is capable of spreading to any other part of your body, including your bones, blood and organs.</p>\n<p>However, it\'s uncommon for mouth cancer to spread further than the lymph nodes near your mouth, although in some cases it may also spread to surrounding bones, such as the jaw bone, and in some cases your lungs.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the tests will examine your lymph nodes, bones and the tissue near the site of your initial tumour to check for the presence of other tumours.</p>\n<p>These tests may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>an&nbsp;<a>X-ray</a></li>\n<li>a&nbsp;<a>magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan</a></li>\n<li>a&nbsp;<a>computerised tomography (CT) scan</a></li>\n<li>a&nbsp;<a>positron emission tomography (PET) scan</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Further biopsies on nearby lymph nodes may also be carried out.</p>\n<h2>Staging and grading</h2>\n<p>Once these tests have been completed it should be possible to tell what stage and grade your cancer is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>staging is a measure of how far the cancer has spread</li>\n<li>the grade describes how aggressive the cancer is and how fast it is likely to spread in future</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This will help determine whether you have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>early mouth cancer (usually curable)</li>\n<li>intermediate mouth cancer (may be curable)</li>\n<li>or advanced mouth cancer (not usually curable, but it is usually possible to slow the spread of the cancer and extend lifespan)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are three grades of mouth cancer: low-grade (the slowest), moderate-grade and high-grade (the most aggressive).</p>\n<p>Grading your cancer helps the doctor decide how quickly you need to be treated &ndash; read more about&nbsp;<a>treating mouth cancer</a>.</p>\n<h2>Treating mouth cancer</h2>\n<div class=\"editor\">\n<p>Your treatment will depend on the type and size of the cancer, the grade and how far it\'s spread &ndash; as well as your general health.</p>\n<h2>Your treatment plan</h2>\n<p>If the cancer hasn\'t spread beyond the mouth or the oropharynx (the bit of your throat at the back of your mouth), a complete cure may be possible using a combination of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.</p>\n<p>If the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, then a cure is unlikely but it will be possible to slow the progress of the cancer and help relieve symptoms by using surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.</p>\n<p>Deciding what treatment is best for you can be difficult. Your care team will make recommendations, but the final decision will be yours.</p>\n<p>Before going to hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions to ask the specialist. For example, what are the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.</p>\n<h2>Before treatment begins</h2>\n<p>Radiotherapy makes the teeth more sensitive and vulnerable to infection so before treatment begins, you\'ll be given a full dental examination and any necessary work will be carried out.</p>\n<p>If you smoke or drink, stopping will increase the chances of your treatment being successful.</p>\n<p>Your specialist nurse and your GP can provide help and support if you are finding it difficult to quit smoking and drinking.</p>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;<a>quitting smoking</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a>cutting down on alcohol</a></p>\n<h2>Surgery</h2>\n<p>For mouth cancer, the aim of surgical treatment is to remove any affected tissue while minimising damage to the rest of the mouth.</p>\n<h3>Photodynamic therapy (PDT)</h3>\n<p>If the cancer is in its very early stages, it may be possible to remove any tumours using a type of laser surgery known as photodynamic therapy (PDT). PDT involves taking a medicine that makes your tissue sensitive to the effects of light. A laser is then used to remove the tumour.</p>\n<h3>Other forms of surgery</h3>\n<p>If your cancer is more advanced, it may be necessary to remove part of your mouth lining and, in some cases, facial skin, which can be replaced using skin grafted from your forearm or chest.</p>\n<p>If your tongue is affected, part of the tongue will have to be removed. This is known as a partial glossectomy. The tongue is then reconstructed using grafted tissue.</p>\n<p>If the cancer has spread to your jawbone it will need to be surgically removed. The jawbone can be replaced by taking bone from another part of your body and grafting it in place.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, other bones, such as cheekbones, may have to be removed to completely remove the cancer.</p>\n<p>These can be replaced with plastic prosthetic bones which are usually very realistic, leaving your physical appearance largely unaffected.</p>\n<p>During surgery, your surgeon may also remove lymph nodes near the site of the initial tumour. This is often done as a preventative measure in case they contain small numbers of cancerous cells that can\'t be detected.</p>\n<h2>Radiotherapy</h2>\n<p><a>Radiotherapy</a>&nbsp;uses doses of radiation to kill cancerous cells. It may be possible to remove the cancer using radiotherapy alone, but it is usually used after surgery to prevent the cancer from reocurring.</p>\n<p>The treatment is normally given every day over the course of three to seven weeks, depending on the size of the cancer and how far it has spread.</p>\n<p>While it kills cancerous cells, radiotherapy can also affect healthy tissue, and it has a number of side effects, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sore, red skin (like sunburn)</li>\n<li><a>mouth ulcers</a>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>sore mouth and throat</li>\n<li>dry mouth</li>\n<li>loss of, or changes in taste</li>\n<li>loss of appetite</li>\n<li>tiredness&nbsp;</li>\n<li>feeling sick</li>\n<li>stiff jaw</li>\n<li>bad breath&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any side effects will be monitored by your care team and treated where possible.</p>\n<p>The side effects of radiotherapy can be distressing, but most of them will pass once the radiotherapy is complete.</p>\n<h3>Internal radiotherapy</h3>\n<p>Internal radiotherapy &ndash; also called brachytherapy &ndash; is often used to treat cancers of the tongue that are in their early stages. It involves placing radioactive implants directly into the tumour while you are under a general anaesthetic.</p>\n<p>They will be left for between one and eight days during which time the cancer cells will receive a much higher dose of radiation than the rest of your mouth.</p>\n<p>Visits by friends and family will need to be restricted due to radiation and pregnant women and children won\'t be able to visit you.</p>\n<p>The radioactive implants will cause your mouth to become swollen, and you will experience some pain five to 10 days after the implants are removed.</p>\n<h2>Chemotherapy</h2>\n<p><a>Chemotherapy</a>&nbsp;is sometimes used in combination with radiotherapy when the cancer is widespread, or if it is thought there is a significant risk of the cancer returning.</p>\n<p>Chemotherapy involves the use of powerful cancer-killing medicines. These medicines damage the DNA of the cancerous cells, interrupting their ability to reproduce.</p>\n<p>Medicines used in chemotherapy can sometimes damage healthy tissue as well as the cancerous tissue. Adverse side effects are common and include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>fatigue (tiredness)</li>\n<li>sore mouth</li>\n<li>mouth ulcers</li>\n<li>feeling sick</li>\n<li><a>being sick</a></li>\n<li>hair loss</li>\n<li>tiredness</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The side effects should stop once the treatment has finished.</p>\n<p>Chemotherapy also weakens your immune system and makes you more vulnerable to infection.</p>\n<h2>Cetuximab</h2>\n<p>Cetuximab is a new type of medication, known as a biologic, used to treat advanced cases of mouth cancer. It is usually used in combination with radiotherapy or chemotherapy.</p>\n<p>Cetuximab targets proteins on the surface of cancer cells, known as epidermal growth factor receptors. These receptors help the cancer to grow, so by targeting these proteins, cetuximab prevents the cancer from spreading.</p>\n<p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) ruled that cetuximab did not represent a cost-effective treatment in most cases and has recommended it only be used in people who:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>are in a good state of health (likely to make a good recovery if treated)</li>\n<li>are unable to have chemotherapy for medical reasons (for example, because they have kidney disease or are pregnant)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Living with mouth cancer</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Having mouth cancer doesn\'t necessarily mean you\'ll have to give up work, but you may need quite a lot of time off, and you may not be able to carry on as you did before treatment.</p>\n<p>If you have cancer you\'re covered by the&nbsp;<a>Disability Discrimination Act</a>. This means that your employer is not allowed to discriminate against you because of your illness. They have a duty to make \"reasonable adjustments\" to help you cope. Examples of these include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>allowing you time off for treatment and medical appointments</li>\n<li>allowing flexibility with working hours, the tasks you have to perform or your working environment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The definition of what is \"reasonable\" depends on the situation. For example, how much it would affect your employer&rsquo;s business.</p>\n<p>It will help if you give your employer as much information as possible about how much time you will need off and when. Talk to your human resources department if you have one. Your union or staff association representative should also be able to give you advice.</p>\n<p>If you\'re having difficulties with your employer, you may be able to receive help from your union or your local&nbsp;<a>Citizens Advice Bureau</a>.</p>\n<h2>Relationships with others</h2>\n<p>It is not always easy to talk about cancer, either for you or your family and friends. You may sense that some people feel awkward around you or avoid you. Being open about how you feel and what your family and friends can do to help may put them at ease. Do not feel shy about telling them that you need some time to yourself, if that is what you need.</p>\n<h2>Money and financial support</h2>\n<p>If you have to stop work or go part-time because of your cancer, you may find it hard to cope financially. If you have cancer or you are caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to one of the following areas of financial support:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you have a job, but cannot work because of your illness, you are entitled to&nbsp;<a >Statutory Sick Pay</a>&nbsp;from your employer.</li>\n<li>If you don\'t have a job and cannot work because of your illness, you may be entitled to&nbsp;<a>Employment and Support Allowance</a>.</li>\n<li>If you are caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to&nbsp;<a>Carer&rsquo;s Allowance</a>.</li>\n<li>You may be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home or if you have a low household income.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Find out as early as possible what help is available to you. Speak to the social worker at your hospital who can give you the information you need.</p>\n<h2>Talk to others</h2>\n<p>If you have questions, your GP or nurse may be able to reassure you. You may find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor or psychologist, or to someone at a specialist helpline. Your GP surgery will have information on these.</p>\n<p>Some people find it helpful to talk to other people who have mouth cancer, either at a local support group or in an internet chatroom, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a>Cancer Research UK: Cancer chat</a>&nbsp;</li>\n<li><a>Macmillan Cancer Support: Head and neck cancer forum</a>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Caring for others with mouth cancer</h2>\n<p>Being a carer is not an easy role. When you are busy responding to the needs of others it can deplete your reserves of emotional and physical energy and make it easy for you to neglect your own health and mental wellbeing. Research on carers&rsquo; health shows that high numbers of carers suffer health effects through caring. If you are trying to combine caring with a paid job or looking after a family, this can cause even more stress.</p>\n<p>If you are caring for someone else, it is important to look after yourself and get as much help as possible. It is in your best interests and those of the person you are caring for.</p>\n<h3>Look after your health</h3>\n<p>Eat regularly and healthily. If you do not have time to sit down for every meal, try to make time to sit down for at least one of your day\'s meals. Instead of relying on fast food snacks, go for healthier options, such as fruit.</p>\n<h3>Look after your emotional health</h3>\n<p>As well as exhaustion, isolation and&nbsp;worries about the person you are caring for, it is understandable if there are times when you feel resentful and then guilty for feeling like this. These feelings are natural.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(134,133,NULL,NULL,'<h1>Paget\'s disease of the nipple:</h1>\n<h2>Symptoms of Paget\'s disease</h2>\n<p>Paget\'s disease usually affects the skin of one nipple and&nbsp;produces&nbsp;<a>eczema-like symptoms</a>, appearing as an itchy, red rash on the nipple that can extend to the darker area of surrounding skin (the areola).</p>\n<p>It can also appear as a small ulcer or dry, red, flaky patches of skin similar to&nbsp;<a>psoriasis</a>.</p>\n<p>Other possible symptoms include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>itchiness or a burning sensation &ndash; alongside visible changes to the nipple (see above)</li>\n<li>bleeding from the skin of the nipple</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you\'re experiencing itchiness, burning or bleeding but the nipple looks normal and isn\'t red, dry or scaly &ndash; this is extremely unlikely to be Paget\'s disease but should still be checked by a doctor.</p>\n<h2>Causes of Paget\'s disease</h2>\n<p>Paget&rsquo;s disease is usually a sign of&nbsp;<a>breast cancer</a>&nbsp;in tissue behind the nipple, or breast tissue away from the nipple.</p>\n<p>The breast cancer can either be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>invasive &ndash;&nbsp;where cancerous cells invade the surrounding breast tissue</li>\n<li>non-invasive&nbsp;&ndash; where the cancerous cells are contained in one or more areas of the breast and are unable to spread</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In a small amount of cases, the only evidence of Paget\'s disease is the nipple changes.</p>\n<p>In about half of all cases of Paget&rsquo;s disease of the nipple, a lump is found in the breast. The majority of people with a lump will have invasive breast cancer, although this does not necessarily mean it has spread.</p>\n<p>Most people with Paget\'s disease of the nipple who don\'t have a lump will have non-invasive breast cancer.</p>\n<h2>Diagnosing Paget\'s disease</h2>\n<p>You should visit your GP if you notice any changes in the skin of your nipple or areola (the darker area of skin around the nipple).</p>\n<p>As Paget&rsquo;s disease is a form of breast cancer, the sooner it\'s diagnosed, the better the outcome is likely to be.</p>\n<p>See your GP if you develop a lump in your breast. While most&nbsp;<a >breast lumps</a>&nbsp;are not cancerous, it\'s important&nbsp;you have it checked out.</p>\n<h2>Diagnosing Paget&rsquo;s disease of the nipple</h2>\n<div>\n<p>As Paget&rsquo;s disease of the nipple is usually a sign of breast cancer, it\'s very important you see your GP if you notice changes to the tissue or skin of your breast.</p>\n<p>In particular, you should tell your GP if you notice any changes to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the skin of your nipple or areola (the darker area of skin around the&nbsp;nipple)</li>\n<li>your breasts, particularly&nbsp;lumps in your breast&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Paget&rsquo;s disease of the nipple can sometimes be confused with&nbsp;<a>eczema</a>, a skin condition that also&nbsp;causes red, itchy and dry skin.</p>\n<p>Therefore, you should visit your GP for a diagnosis rather&nbsp;than assuming you have eczema. Paget&rsquo;s disease is a form&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a>breast cancer</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;the sooner it\'s diagnosed, the better the outcome is likely to be.</p>\n<p>Your GP will examine both breasts, even if you only have a problem with&nbsp;one of them. They may also ask you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>about your symptoms and how long you have had them</li>\n<li>whether you have a history of eczema, or have eczema anywhere else on your body</li>\n<li>whether you have a personal or family history of breast cancer</li>\n<li>your age and whether you have experienced the&nbsp;<a>menopause</a>&nbsp;(when a woman\'s monthly periods stop)</li>\n<li>whether you\'re taking any medication, including&nbsp;<a>hormone replacement therapy (HRT)</a>, which is used to treat some of the symptoms of the menopause, or the&nbsp;<a>oral contraceptive pill</a></li>\n<li>how much&nbsp;<a>alcohol</a>&nbsp;you drink</li>\n<li>how much you weigh and if you have recently gained weight</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your GP thinks you may have breast cancer, they will refer you to a specialist breast clinic for tests.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Breast clinic</h2>\n<p>When you visit a breast clinic you will have tests to find out whether you have breast cancer and, if you have,&nbsp;what type of breast cancer.</p>\n<p>Staff at the clinic may take photographs of your breasts to record their current appearance and to help identify any further changes that may occur.</p>\n<p>Tests carried out at the clinic may include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>an examination of your breast to check for lumps or other abnormalities</li>\n<li>a&nbsp;mammogram (if you are&nbsp;35 years of age or over)</li>\n<li>an&nbsp;<a>ultrasound scan</a>&nbsp;&ndash; which is the first line of investigation used in younger women</li>\n<li>a skin biopsy will be carried out if Paget&rsquo;s disease is suspected</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Mammogram</h3>\n<p>A mammogram is a simple procedure that uses&nbsp;<a>X-rays</a>&nbsp;to create an image of the inside of your breasts. It can identify early changes in your breast tissue when it may be difficult to feel a lump.</p>\n<p>Younger women often&nbsp;have denser breasts than older women, which can make identifying changes more difficult. Therefore, mammograms are not as effective in women under 35 years of age. If you\'re under 35, your doctor may suggest you have a breast ultrasound instead (see below).</p>\n<p>However after a diagnosis of Paget&rsquo;s disease has been confirmed, mammography will become an important part of pre-surgery assessment.</p>\n<p>During&nbsp;a mammogram, the radiographer will position one of your breasts on a flat X-ray plate. A second X-ray plate will press down on your breast from above, so that it is temporarily compressed and flattened between the two plates.</p>\n<p>An X-ray will be taken, which will give a clear image of the inside of your breast. The procedure will then be carried out on your other breast.</p>\n<p>Having a mammogram can be slightly uncomfortable or even painful, but the procedure will only take a few minutes. Your doctor will examine the image produced by a mammogram for indications of cancer.</p>\n<h3>Breast ultrasound</h3>\n<p>If you are under&nbsp;35 years of age, a breast&nbsp;<a>ultrasound</a>&nbsp;may be recommended. This is because your breast tissue may be too dense for a mammogram. Your doctor may also suggest a breast ultrasound if they need to find out whether a lump in your breast is solid or contains liquid.</p>\n<p>Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your breasts. An ultrasound probe or sensor will be placed over your breasts to create an image on a screen. The image will show any lumps or abnormalities&nbsp;present in your breasts.</p>\n<h3>Skin biopsy</h3>\n<p>A&nbsp;skin&nbsp;<a>biopsy</a>&nbsp;is used to diagnose Paget&rsquo;s disease. A biopsy is where a small sample of tissue is taken for examination under a microscope and tests to see if it is cancerous.</p>\n<h2>Further tests</h2>\n<p>There are a number of other tests that can be used if a diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed and help determine what types of treatment might be used.</p>\n<h2>Treating Paget&rsquo;s disease of the nipple</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Paget&rsquo;s disease of the nipple is often associated with other forms of breast cancer.</p>\n<p>It\'s usually&nbsp;treated in the same way as more common types of breast cancer, either by removing the cancerous section of the breast or sometimes by removing the entire breast &ndash; a procedure known as a mastectomy (see below).</p>\n<p>You can discuss any concerns you have with your oncologist (cancer specialist) who will be able to explain each phase of your treatment.</p>\n<h2>Surgery</h2>\n<p>If you\'re diagnosed with Paget&rsquo;s disease, surgery is often the first form of treatment you will receive. There are two main types of surgery. They are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>mastectomy &ndash; surgery to remove the whole breast, which can be followed by reconstructive surgery to recreate the removed breast</li>\n<li>breast-conserving surgery &ndash; surgery to remove the cancerous lump (tumour) in your breast</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These types of surgery will also involve removing your nipple and the darker area of skin surrounding it (the areola).</p>\n<p>The two different types of surgery are discussed in more detail below.</p>\n<h3>Mastectomy</h3>\n<p>A mastectomy removes all your breast tissue, including your nipple. You may need to have a mastectomy if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the tumour is large or in the centre of&nbsp;your breast</li>\n<li>there is more than one area of breast cancer</li>\n<li>breast-conserving surgery (see below) is not able to provide acceptable results</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If lymph nodes (small glands) are removed from your armpit during a mastectomy, the scarring may block the filtering action of the lymph nodes, resulting in a condition called lymphoedema. This is a long-term condition, but can be treated with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>massage</li>\n<li>compression sleeves &ndash; tightly fitting bandages that push excess fluid out of your arm</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lymphoedema can develop months or sometimes years after surgery. See your breast care nurse or GP if you notice any swelling in your arm or hand on the side of your operation.</p>\n<h3>Breast-conserving surgery</h3>\n<p>Breast-conserving surgery aims to save as much of your breast as possible while removing the cancer with a rim of healthy tissue.</p>\n<p>If you have Paget&rsquo;s disease, your nipple and areola will be removed. You should be offered reconstructive surgery to improve the appearance of your breast after surgery (see below).</p>\n<p>If you have breast-conserving surgery, the amount of breast tissue removed will depend on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the size of the tumour in relation to the size of your breast</li>\n<li>whether the tumour is in one place or scattered throughout your breast</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your surgeon will remove an area of healthy breast tissue around the cancer so it can be tested for traces of cancer.</p>\n<p>If cancer cells are found in the surrounding tissue, you may need to have more tissue surgically removed from your breast.</p>\n<p>After having breast-conserving surgery, it\'s likely you will need radiation treatment (<a>radiotherapy</a>) to destroy any remaining cancer cells.</p>\n<h2>Breast reconstruction</h2>\n<p>If you have a mastectomy, you may be able to have reconstructive surgery to recreate your breast. This can be done by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>inserting a breast implant</li>\n<li>using tissue from another part of your body to create a new breast</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The reconstruction can be carried out at the time of your mastectomy or at a later stage. You should discuss your options fully with your surgeon and breast nurse before making a decision.</p>\n<p>For example, it may be possible to have reconstructive surgery after breast-conserving surgery to improve the appearance of your breast and create a nipple.</p>\n<h3>Creating a nipple</h3>\n<p>A nipple can be created by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>having a nipple tattooed onto the skin</li>\n<li>using your own body tissue, such as tissue from your other nipple, although around half of these flatten out and shrink over time</li>\n<li>using a stick-on latex (rubber) nipple, which can be made from a mould of your other nipple so that&nbsp;they are identical; you stick it on every day with glue and it can be removed for washing</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Prostheses</h2>\n<p>If you decide not to have breast reconstruction, you can wear a false breast or breast prosthesis, which are available free on the NHS.</p>\n<p>After having a mastectomy, you may have a temporary, fibre-filled prosthesis and a permanent prosthesis made from silicone, which can be replaced every two years.</p>\n<h2>Further treatment</h2>\n<p>After your surgery, you may need further treatment if you have invasive breast cancer, where the cancerous cells have spread into other tissue in your breast.</p>\n<p>If you had non-invasive breast cancer, where the breast cancer cells were contained in one area of your breast, surgery may be all the treatment you need.</p>\n<p>Other types of treatment for breast cancer include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a>chemotherapy</a>&nbsp;&ndash; cytotoxic medication that prevents cancer cells from dividing and growing is used to destroy cancer cells</li>\n<li><a>radiotherapy</a>&nbsp;&ndash; where controlled doses of high-energy radiation, usually&nbsp;<a>X-rays</a>, are used to destroy cancer cells</li>\n<li>biological therapy &ndash; if your breast cancer is HER2 positive, biological therapy, usually a medication called trastuzumab, can be used to treat the cancer by stopping the effects of HER2 and helping your immune system fight off cancer cells</li>\n<li>hormone therapy &ndash; if your breast cancer is hormone-receptor positive, hormone therapy can be used to treat the cancer by lowering the levels of hormones in your body or stopping their effects</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(135,134,NULL,NULL,'<h1>Skin cancer (melanoma):</h1>\n<h2>About melanoma</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that can spread to other organs in the body.</p>\n<p>The most common sign of melanoma is the appearance of a new&nbsp;mole or a change in an existing mole. This can happen anywhere on the body, but the back, legs, arms and face are most commonly affected.</p>\n<p>In most cases, melanomas have an irregular shape and more than one colour. They may also be larger than normal moles and can sometimes be itchy or bleed.</p>\n<p>An \"ABCDE checklist\" has been developed for people to tell the difference between a normal mole and a melanoma.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Nodular melanoma</h2>\n<p>Nodular melanoma is a fast-developing type of melanoma, most common in middle-aged people. It may not develop from an existing mole and can appear in areas of skin that aren\'t regularly exposed to the sun.</p>\n<h2>Lentigo maligna melanoma</h2>\n<p>Lentigo maligna melanoma is most common in elderly people and those who have spent a lot of time outdoors. It is common on the face and tends to grow slowly over a number of years.</p>\n<h2>Acral lentiginous melanoma&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Acral lentiginous melanoma&nbsp;is&nbsp;a rare type of melanoma that usually appears on the palms of the hands and the soles or big toenails of the feet. This is the most common type of melanoma in people with dark skin.</p>\n<h2>Why does melanoma happen?</h2>\n<p>Melanoma happens when some cells in the skin begin to develop abnormally. It is thought that exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light from natural or artificial sources may be partly responsible.</p>\n<p>Certain things can increase your chances of developing melanoma, such as having:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>lots of moles or freckles</li>\n<li>pale skin that burns easily</li>\n<li>red or blonde hair</li>\n<li>a family member who has had melanoma</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Symptoms of melanoma</h2>\n<div>\n<p>The first sign of a melanoma is often a new mole or a change in the appearance of an existing mole.</p>\n<p>Normal&nbsp;moles are usually round or oval, with a smooth edge, and&nbsp;no&nbsp;bigger than 6mm (1/4 inch) in diameter.</p>\n<p>See your GP as soon as possible if you notice changes in a mole, freckle or patch of skin, especially if the changes happen over a few weeks or months.</p>\n<p>Signs to look out for include a mole that is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>getting bigger</li>\n<li>changing shape</li>\n<li>changing colour</li>\n<li>bleeding or becoming crusty</li>\n<li>itchy or painful</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A&nbsp;helpful&nbsp;way to tell the difference between a normal mole and a melanoma is the ABCDE checklist:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Asymmetrical &ndash; melanomas have 2 very different halves and are an irregular shape.</li>\n<li>Border &ndash; melanomas have a notched or ragged border.</li>\n<li>Colours &ndash; melanomas will be a mix of 2 or more colours.</li>\n<li>Diameter &ndash; melanomas are larger than 6mm (1/4 inch) in diameter.</li>\n<li>Enlargement or elevation &ndash; a mole that changes size over time&nbsp;is more likely to be a melanoma.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Melanomas can appear anywhere on your body, but they most commonly&nbsp;appear on the&nbsp;back, legs, arms and face. They may sometimes develop underneath a nail.</p>\n<p>In rare cases, melanoma can develop in&nbsp;the eye. Noticing a dark spot or changes in vision can be signs, although it is more likely to be&nbsp;diagnosed during a routine eye examination.</p>\n<h2>Causes of melanoma</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Most skin cancer is caused by ultraviolet (UV) light damaging the DNA in skin cells. The main source of UV light is sunlight.</p>\n<p>Sunlight contains 3 types of UV light:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ultraviolet A (UVA)</li>\n<li>ultraviolet B (UVB)</li>\n<li>ultraviolet C (UVC)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>UVC is filtered out by the Earth\'s atmosphere, but UVA and UVB damage skin over time, making it more likely for skin cancers to develop. UVB is thought to be the main cause of skin cancer.</p>\n<p>Artificial sources of light, such as sunlamps and tanning beds, also increase your risk of developing skin cancer.</p>\n<p>Repeated&nbsp;<a>sunburn</a>, either by the sun or artificial sources of light, increases the risk of melanoma in people of all ages.</p>\n<h2>Moles</h2>\n<p>You&nbsp;are at an increased&nbsp;risk of melanoma if you have&nbsp;lots of&nbsp;moles&nbsp;on your body, especially if they are large&nbsp;(over 5mm) or unusually shaped.</p>\n<p>Having just one unusually shaped or very large mole increases your risk of melanoma by 60%.</p>\n<p>For this reason, it\'s important to monitor moles for changes and avoid exposing them to the sun.</p>\n<h2>Family history</h2>\n<p>Research suggests that if you have 2 or more close relatives who have had non-melanoma skin cancer, your chances of developing the condition may be increased.</p>\n<h2>Increased risk</h2>\n<p>Certain&nbsp;things&nbsp;are believed to increase your chances of developing all types of skin cancer, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>pale skin that does not tan easily</li>\n<li>red or blonde hair</li>\n<li>blue eyes</li>\n<li>older age</li>\n<li>a large number of freckles</li>\n<li>an area of skin previously damaged by burning or radiotherapy treatment</li>\n<li>a condition that suppresses your immune system &ndash; such as&nbsp;<a>HIV</a></li>\n<li>medicines that suppress your immune system (immunosuppressants) &ndash; commonly used after organ transplants</li>\n<li>exposure to certain chemicals &ndash; such as creosote and arsenic</li>\n<li>a previous diagnosis of skin cancer</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Diagnosing melanoma</h2>\n<div>\n<p>A diagnosis of melanoma will usually begin with an examination of your skin. Your GP will refer you to a specialist if they suspect melanoma.</p>\n<p>Some GPs take digital photographs of suspected tumours so they can email them to a specialist for assessment.</p>\n<p>As melanoma is a relatively rare condition, many GPs will only see a case every few years. It\'s important&nbsp;to monitor your moles and return to your GP if you notice any changes. Taking photos to document any changes will help with diagnosis.</p>\n<h2>Seeing a specialist</h2>\n<p>In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (<a>NICE</a>) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of malignant melanoma and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected&nbsp;malignant melanoma, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on&nbsp;<a>Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral</a>.</p>\n<p>You will be referred to a dermatology clinic or hospital&nbsp;for further testing if melanoma is suspected. You should see a specialist within two weeks of seeing your GP.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;dermatologist&nbsp;or plastic surgeon will examine the mole and the rest of your skin. They may&nbsp;also remove the mole and send it for testing (<a>biopsy</a>) to&nbsp;check whether the mole is cancerous. A biopsy is usually carried out under&nbsp;<a>local anaesthetic</a>,&nbsp;meaning the area around the mole will be numbed and you won\'t feel any pain.</p>\n<p>If cancer is confirmed, you will usually need a further operation, most often carried out by a plastic surgeon, to remove a wider area&nbsp;of skin.</p>\n<h2>Further tests</h2>\n<p>Further tests will be carried out if there is a concern the cancer has spread into other organs, bones or your bloodstream.</p>\n<h3>Sentinel lymph node biopsy</h3>\n<p>If melanoma spreads, it will usually begin spreading through channels in the skin (called lymphatics) to the nearest group of glands (called lymph nodes).&nbsp;Lymph nodes&nbsp;are part of the body&rsquo;s immune system, helping to remove unwanted bacteria and particles from the body.</p>\n<p>Sentinel lymph node biopsy is a test to determine whether microscopic amounts of melanoma (less than would show up on any X-ray or scan) might have spread to the lymph nodes. It is usually carried out by a specialist plastic surgeon, while you are under&nbsp;<a>general anaesthetic</a>.</p>\n<p>A combination of blue dye and a weak radioactive chemical is injected around your scar. This is usually done just before the wider&nbsp;area&nbsp;of skin is removed. The solution follows the same channels in the skin as any melanoma.</p>\n<p>The first lymph node this reaches&nbsp;is known as&nbsp;the &ldquo;sentinel&rdquo; lymph node. The surgeon can&nbsp;locate and remove the sentinel node, leaving the others intact. The node is then examined for microscopic specks of melanoma&nbsp;(this process can take several weeks).</p>\n<p>If the sentinel lymph node is clear of melanoma, it\'s extremely unlikely that any other lymph nodes are affected. This can be reassuring&nbsp;because if melanoma spreads to the lymph nodes, it\'s more likely to spread elsewhere.</p>\n<p>If the sentinel lymph node contains melanoma, there is a risk that other lymph nodes in the same group will contain melanoma.</p>\n<p>Your surgeon should discuss the pros and cons of having a sentinel lymph node biopsy before you agree to the procedure. Sentinel lymph node biopsy does not cure melanoma, but&nbsp;is used to investigate the outlook of your condition.</p>\n<p>An operation to remove the remaining lymph nodes in the group&nbsp;may be recommended. This is known as a completion lymph node dissection or completion lymphadenectomy.</p>\n<p>Other tests you may have include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a&nbsp;<a>computerised tomography (CT) scan</a></li>\n<li>a&nbsp;<a>magnetic resonance imaging&nbsp;(MRI) scan</a></li>\n<li>a positron emission tomography (PET) scan</li>\n<li><a>blood tests</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Treating melanoma</h2>\n<div>\n<h2>Melanoma stages</h2>\n<p>Health professionals use a staging system to describe how far melanoma has grown into the skin (the thickness) and whether it has spread. The type of treatment you receive will depend on what stage the melanoma has reached.</p>\n<p>The melanoma stages can be described as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stage 0 &ndash; the melanoma is on the surface of the skin. &nbsp;</li>\n<li>Stage 1A &ndash; the melanoma is less than 1mm thick.</li>\n<li>Stage 1B &ndash; the melanoma is 1-2mm thick, or the melanoma is less than 1mm thick and the surface of the skin is broken (ulcerated) or its cells are dividing faster than usual (mitotic activity).</li>\n<li>Stage 2A &ndash; the melanoma is 2-4mm thick, or the melanoma is 1-2mm thick and is ulcerated.</li>\n<li>Stage 2B &ndash; the melanoma is thicker than 4mm, or the melanoma is 2-4mm thick and ulcerated.</li>\n<li>Stage 2C &ndash; the melanoma is thicker than 4mm and ulcerated.</li>\n<li>Stage 3A &ndash; the melanoma has spread into 1 to 3 nearby lymph nodes, but they are not enlarged; the melanoma is not ulcerated and has not spread further.</li>\n<li>Stage 3B &ndash; the melanoma is ulcerated and has spread into 1&nbsp;to 3 nearby lymph nodes but they are not enlarged, or the melanoma is not ulcerated and has spread into 1 to 3 nearby lymph nodes and they are enlarged, or the melanoma has spread to small areas of skin or lymphatic channels, but not to nearby lymph nodes.</li>\n<li>Stage 3C &ndash; the melanoma is ulcerated and has spread into 1 to 3 nearby lymph nodes and they are enlarged, or&nbsp;the melanoma has spread into 4 or more lymph nodes nearby.</li>\n<li>Stage 4 &ndash; the melanoma cells have spread to other areas of the body, such as the lungs, brain or other parts of the skin.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Want to know more?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cancer Research UK:&nbsp;<a>Treating melanoma</a></li>\n<li>Cancer Research UK:&nbsp;<a >Stages of melanoma</a></li>\n<li>Macmillan:&nbsp;<a>Melanoma</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Stage 1 melanoma</h2>\n<p>Treating stage 1 melanoma will involve surgically removing the melanoma and a small area of skin around it &ndash; this is known as surgical excision.</p>\n<p>Surgical excision&nbsp;is usually&nbsp;carried out&nbsp;under&nbsp;<a>local anaesthetic</a>. This means you will be awake but the area around the melanoma will be numbed, so you won\'t feel pain. In some cases,&nbsp;<a>general anaesthetic</a>&nbsp;is used, which means you will be asleep during the procedure.</p>\n<p>If a surgical excision is likely to leave a significant scar, it may be done in combination with a skin graft. A skin graft involves removing a patch of healthy skin, usually&nbsp;taken from a part of your body where scarring cannot be seen, such as your back. It is then connected, or grafted, to the affected area. Skin grafts or flaps are used when the area of skin being removed is too big to close using a direct method.</p>\n<p>Once the melanoma has been removed, there is little possibility it will return and no further treatment should be required. You will probably be asked to come for follow-up appointments before being discharged.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Stage 2 and 3 melanoma</h2>\n<p>As with stage&nbsp;1 melanomas, any affected areas of skin will be removed.&nbsp;The remaining skin is&nbsp;either closed directly, or a skin graft or flap may be&nbsp;carried out&nbsp;if necessary.</p>\n<h2>Sentinel node biopsy</h2>\n<p>Sentinel node biopsy, which is not a mandatory procedure, will be discussed with you. If you decide to go ahead&nbsp;with the procedure&nbsp;and the results show no spread to nearby lymph nodes, it is unlikely you will have further problems with this melanoma.</p>\n<p>If the test confirms melanoma has spread to nearby nodes, your specialist will discuss with you whether further surgery is required. Additional surgery involves removing the remaining nodes, known as a completion lymph node&nbsp;dissection or completion lymphadenectomy.</p>\n<h2>Lymph nodes</h2>\n<p>If the melanoma has spread to nearby lymph nodes, you may need further surgery to remove them. Your doctor will&nbsp;have felt a lump in your lymph nodes and&nbsp;the diagnosis of melanoma is usually confirmed using a needle biopsy (fine needle aspiration).&nbsp;Removing the affected nodes requires a procedure called a block dissection, performed under general anaesthetic.</p>\n<p>While the surgeon will try to ensure&nbsp;the rest of your lymphatic system can function normally, there is a risk that the removal of lymph nodes will disrupt the lymphatic system, leading to a build-up of fluids in your limbs. This is known as&nbsp;<a>lymphoedema</a>.</p>\n<h2>Follow-up</h2>\n<p>Once the melanoma has been removed, you will need follow-up appointments to see how you are recovering and to watch for any sign of the melanoma returning.</p>\n<p>You may be offered treatment to try to prevent the melanoma&nbsp;returning. This is called adjuvant treatment. There is not much evidence that adjuvant treatment helps prevent melanoma from coming back, so this is only offered as part of a clinical trial.</p>\n<h2>Stage 4 melanoma</h2>\n<p>It may not be possible to cure melanoma if it has:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>been&nbsp;diagnosed at its most advanced stage</li>\n<li>spread to another part of your body (metastasis)</li>\n<li>come back in another part of your body after treatment (recurrent cancer)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Treatment is available and given in the hope that it can slow the cancer\'s growth, reduce any symptoms you may have and possibly extend your life expectancy.</p>\n<p>You may be able to have surgery to remove other melanomas that have occurred away from the original site.</p>\n<p>You may also be able to have other treatments to help with symptoms. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>radiotherapy&nbsp;</li>\n<li>drug treatments</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Radiotherapy</h2>\n<p><a>Radiotherapy</a>&nbsp;may be used after an operation to remove your lymph nodes, and can also be used to help relieve the symptoms of advanced melanoma.</p>\n<p>Radiotherapy uses controlled doses of radiation to kill cancer cells. It is given at the hospital as a series of 10-15 minute daily sessions, with a rest period over the weekend.</p>\n<p>The side effects of radiotherapy include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>tiredness</li>\n<li>nausea</li>\n<li>loss of appetite</li>\n<li>hair loss</li>\n<li>sore skin</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many side effects can be prevented or controlled with medicines your doctor can prescribe, so let them know about any that you experience. After treatment has finished, the side effects of radiotherapy should gradually reduce.</p>\n<p>Want to know more?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cancer Research UK:&nbsp;<a>Radiotherapy for melanoma</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Drug treatment</h2>\n<p>In recent years there have been major advancements in treating melanoma. The medications used to treat melanoma are changing as new formulations are being introduced into clinics.</p>\n<p>The medications currently being used include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>vemurafenib</li>\n<li>ipilimumab</li>\n<li>nivolumab</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, not everyone is suitable for these drugs. Your specialist will discuss an appropriate treatment with you, and many people are entered into clinical trials (see clinical trials,&nbsp;below).</p>\n<p>Some of the available medications are discussed below.</p>\n<h2>Chemotherapy</h2>\n<p><a>Chemotherapy</a>&nbsp;involves using anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to kill the cancer.&nbsp;It is normally used to treat melanoma that has spread to parts of the body and is mainly given to help relieve symptoms of advanced melanoma.</p>\n<p>Several different chemotherapy drugs are used to treat melanoma and are occasionally given in combination. The drugs most commonly used for melanoma are dacarbazine and temozolomide. However, many different types of drugs can be used. Your specialist can discuss with you which drugs are the most suitable.</p>\n<p>Chemotherapy is usually given as an outpatient treatment, which means you will not have to stay in hospital overnight. Dacarbazine is given through a drip and temozolomide is given in tablet form. Chemotherapy sessions are usually given once every 3 to 4 weeks, with gaps between treatment intended to give your body and blood time to recover.</p>\n<p>The main side effects of chemotherapy are caused by their influence on the rest of the body. Side effects include infection, nausea and vomiting, tiredness and sore mouth. Many side effects can be prevented or controlled with medicines that your doctor can prescribe.</p>\n<h2>Electrochemotherapy</h2>\n<p>Electrochemotherapy is a possible treatment for melanoma. It may be considered if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>surgery isn\'t suitable or hasn\'t worked</li>\n<li>radiotherapy and chemotherapy haven\'t worked</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The procedure involves giving chemotherapy intravenously (directly into a vein).&nbsp;Short, powerful pulses of electricity are then directed to the tumour using electrodes.</p>\n<p>These electrical pulses allow the medicine to enter the tumour cells more effectively and cause more damage to the tumour.&nbsp;The procedure&nbsp;is usually&nbsp;carried out using general anaesthetic (where you\'re asleep) but some people may&nbsp;be able to have&nbsp;local anaesthetic&nbsp;(where you\'re awake but the area is numbed).</p>\n<p>Depending on how many tumours need to be treated, the procedure can take up to an hour to complete. The main side effect is some pain where the electrode was used, which can last for a few days and may require painkillers.</p>\n<p>It usually takes around 6 weeks for results to appear and the procedure usually needs to be repeated.</p>\n<p>Your specialist can give you more detailed information about this treatment option.</p>\n<p>Read the NICE (2013) guidelines on&nbsp;<a>Electrochemotherapy for metastases in the skin</a>.</p>\n<h2>Immunotherapy</h2>\n<p>Immunotherapy uses drugs (often derived from substances that occur naturally in the body) that encourage your body\'s immune system to work against the melanoma. Two such treatments in regular use for melanoma are&nbsp;interferon-alpha and interleukin-2. Both are given as an injection (into the blood, under the skin, or into lumps of melanoma).</p>\n<p>Side effects include flu-like symptoms, such as chills, a high temperature, joint pain and fatigue.</p>\n<h2>Vaccines</h2>\n<p>There is ongoing research&nbsp;into producing a vaccine for melanoma, either to treat advanced melanoma or to be used&nbsp;after surgery in patients who have a high risk of the melanoma coming back.</p>\n<p>Vaccines are designed to focus the body&rsquo;s immune system so it recognises the melanoma and can work against it. Vaccines are usually given as an injection under the skin every few weeks, often over a period of months.</p>\n<p>As more research is needed into vaccines, they are only given as part of a clinical trial.</p>\n<h2>Monoclonal antibodies</h2>\n<p>Our immune systems make antibodies all the time, usually as a way of controlling infections. They are substances that recognise something which doesn&rsquo;t belong in the body and help to destroy it. Antibodies can be produced in the laboratory and can be made to recognise and lock onto specific targets, either in the cancer or in specific parts of the body.</p>\n<p>Antibodies produced in the laboratory are usually called monoclonal antibodies.</p>\n<h3>Ipilimumab</h3>\n<p>Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody that has been licensed for use in the UK since 2011. It works like an accelerator for the immune system, allowing the body to work against all sorts of conditions, including cancer.</p>\n<p>In December 2012, NICE recommended ipilimumab as a possible treatment for people with previously treated advanced melanoma that has spread or cannot be surgically removed.</p>\n<h2>Signalling inhibitors</h2>\n<p>Signalling inhibitors are drugs that work by disrupting the messages (signals) a cancer uses to co-ordinate its growth. There are hundreds of these signals, and it is difficult to know which ones need to be blocked. Most of the signals have short, technical names. Two that are of current interest in relation to melanoma are BRAF and MEK.</p>\n<p>There are drugs available that can interfere with these signals, but most are currently only widely available as part of clinical trials.</p>\n<p>NICE recommends a signalling inhibitor called vemurafenib as a possible treatment for melanoma that has spread or cannot be surgically removed.</p>\n<p>Want to know more?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cancer Research UK:&nbsp;<a>Biological therapy for melanoma</a>.</li>\n<li>Cancer Research UK:&nbsp;<a>Chemotherapy for melanoma</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Clinical trials</h2>\n<p>All new treatment for cancer (and other diseases) is first given to patients in a clinical trial.</p>\n<p>A clinical trial or study is an extremely rigorous way of testing a drug on people. Patients are monitored for any effects of the drug on the cancer, as well as side effects. Many people with melanoma are offered entry into clinical trials, but some people are suspicious of the process.</p>\n<p>There are a few key things to know about clinical trials:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overall, patients in clinical trials do better than those on routine treatment, even when receiving a drug that would be given routinely.</li>\n<li>All clinical trials are highly regulated.</li>\n<li>All new treatments will first become available through clinical trials.</li>\n<li>Even where a new drug fails to offer any benefits over existing treatment, the knowledge that we gain from the trial is valuable for future patients.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are asked to take part in a trial, you will be given an information sheet and, if you want to take part, you will be asked to sign a consent form. You can refuse or withdraw from a clinical trial without it affecting your care.</p>\n<p>Want to know more?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cancer Research UK:&nbsp;<a>Melanoma research</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Deciding against treatment for Stage 4 melanoma</h2>\n<p>Many of the treatments described above have unpleasant side effects that can affect your quality of life. You may decide against having treatment if it is unlikely to significantly extend your life expectancy, or if you do not have symptoms causing you pain or discomfort.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(136,135,NULL,NULL,'<h1>Stomach cancer:</h1>\n<h2>Symptoms of stomach cancer</h2>\n<div >\n<p>Many symptoms of stomach cancer are similar to less serious conditions, so it can be difficult to recognise in the early stages.</p>\n<p>Early stage symptoms include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>persistent&nbsp;<a>indigestion</a></li>\n<li>trapped wind and frequent burping</li>\n<li><a>heartburn</a></li>\n<li>feeling full very quickly when eating</li>\n<li>feeling bloated after eating</li>\n<li>feeling sick</li>\n<li>pain in your stomach or breastbone</li>\n<li>difficulty swallowing (<a>dysphagia</a>)</li>\n<li>vomiting (the vomit may be streaked with blood), although this is uncommon in the early stages</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Advanced stomach cancer</h2>\n<p>Symptoms of more advanced stomach cancer include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>blood in your stools, or black stools</li>\n<li>loss of appetite</li>\n<li>weight loss</li>\n<li>tiredness</li>\n<li>lumpiness and swelling in your stomach (caused by a build-up of fluid)</li>\n<li><a>anaemia</a>&nbsp;(a reduced number of red blood cells that can cause you to feel tired and breathless)</li>\n<li>yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>When to seek medical help</h2>\n<p>Stomach cancer is usually easier to treat if it\'s diagnosed early. It\'s therefore&nbsp;important for your GP to refer you to a specialist as soon as possible if stomach cancer is suspected.</p>\n<p>Stomach cancer is much more common in older people, with 90 out of 100 cases occurring in people who are over 55 years of age.</p>\n<p>Indigestion is a very common symptom in the general population. However, it\'s unlikely that someone with indigestion who\'s under the age of 55 will have stomach cancer.</p>\n<p>However,&nbsp;see your GP if you have indigestion and weight loss, anaemia or persistent vomiting. They&nbsp;should refer you to a specialist for further testing.</p>\n<p>Also see your GP if you have difficulty swallowing. This&nbsp;isn\'t a common symptom among the general population and the cause should always be investigated.</p>\n<h2>Causes of stomach cancer</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Stomach cancer is caused by changes in the cells of the stomach, although it\'s unclear exactly why these changes occur.</p>\n<p>Cancer begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the DNA in cells, which can affect how they grow. This means cells grow and reproduce&nbsp;uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour.</p>\n<p>Left untreated, cancer can spread to other parts of the body, usually through the lymphatic system (a network of vessels and glands called lymph nodes located throughout the body).</p>\n<p>Once the cancer reaches your lymphatic system, it\'s capable of spreading to other parts of your body, including your blood, bones and organs.</p>\n<p>It\'s not known what triggers the&nbsp;changes in DNA&nbsp;that lead to stomach cancer and why only a small number of people develop the condition.</p>\n<h2>Increased risk</h2>\n<p>However, evidence suggests that a number of different factors can affect your&nbsp;chances of developing stomach cancer. These are discussed below.</p>\n<h3>Age and gender</h3>\n<p>Your risk of developing stomach cancer increases with age. Most cases occur in people aged 55 or over.</p>\n<p>For reasons that are unclear, men are twice as likely as women to develop stomach cancer.</p>\n<h2>Smoking</h2>\n<p>People who smoke are about twice as likely to develop stomach cancer compared with non-smokers. This is because you swallow some cigarette smoke when you inhale and it ends up in your stomach. Cigarettes contain&nbsp;harmful chemicals which can damage the cells in your stomach.</p>\n<p>The more you smoke and the longer you\'ve been smoking, the bigger the risk.&nbsp;In the UK, around 1&nbsp;in every 5 cases of stomach cancer (20%) is thought to be caused by smoking.</p>\n<h3>H. pylori infection</h3>\n<p>Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)&nbsp;is a common type of bacteria. In most people, these bacteria are harmless, but&nbsp;in some people an H. pylori infection can cause problems such as&nbsp;<a>stomach ulcers</a>, recurring bouts of&nbsp;<a>indigestion</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;long-term inflammation of the stomach lining (chronic atrophic gastritis).</p>\n<p>Research has found&nbsp;people with severe chronic&nbsp;atrophic gastritis have&nbsp;an increased&nbsp;risk of developing stomach cancer, although this risk is still small.</p>\n<h3>Diet</h3>\n<p>A diet rich in pickled vegetables, such as pickled onions or piccalilli, salted fish, salt in general and smoked meats, such as pastrami or smoked beef, increases your risk of stomach cancer.</p>\n<p>Countries where this type of diet is popular, such as Japan, tend to have much higher rates of stomach cancer than the UK.</p>\n<p>A high fibre diet with&nbsp;five portions of fruit and vegetables a day&nbsp;will help protect against stomach cancer, and a diet high in fats and processed food and red meat will increase your risk of getting stomach cancer.</p>\n<h3>Family history</h3>\n<p>You\'re more likely to develop stomach cancer if you have a close relative with the condition, such as one of your parents or a sibling (brother or sister). In such cases, it may be appropriate for your doctor to arrange genetic counselling.</p>\n<p>It\'s not fully understood why stomach cancer seems to run in families. It may be because of shared risk factors, such as having similar diets or having an H. pylori infection, or because of certain genes you inherit from your parents.</p>\n<p>In around one in 50 cases of stomach cancer, testing has found that people share a mutation in a gene known as E-cadherin.</p>\n<p>Research into stomach cancer has also shown that you may be more at risk of getting the condition if you have the blood type A. Your&nbsp;blood type is passed on from your parents, so this could be another way in which family history may increase your risk of developing stomach cancer.</p>\n<p>There\'s also a condition that runs in families called familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), which may increase your risk of developing stomach cancer. FAP causes small growths, called polyps, to form in your digestive system, and is known to increase your risk of developing&nbsp;<a>bowel cancer</a>.</p>\n<h3>Having another type of cancer</h3>\n<p>Your risk of developing stomach cancer is increased if you\'ve had another type of cancer, such as&nbsp;<a>cancer of the oesophagus</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>non-Hodgkin lymphoma</a>&nbsp;(cancer that develops in your white blood cells).</p>\n<p>For men, the risk of getting stomach cancer is increased after having&nbsp;<a>prostate cancer</a>,&nbsp;<a>bladder cancer</a>,&nbsp;<a>breast cancer</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>testicular cancer</a>. For women, the risk of developing stomach cancer increases after having&nbsp;<a>ovarian cancer</a>,&nbsp;<a>breast cancer</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>cervical cancer</a>.</p>\n<h3>Certain medical conditions</h3>\n<p>Having certain medical conditions can also increase your risk of developing stomach cancer, such as&nbsp;<a>pernicious anaemia</a>&nbsp;(a vitamin B12 deficiency, which occurs when your body can\'t absorb it properly), and&nbsp;<a>peptic stomach ulcers</a>&nbsp;(an ulcer in your stomach lining, often caused by H. pylori infection).</p>\n<h3>Stomach surgery</h3>\n<p>If you\'ve had stomach surgery, or surgery to a part of your body that affects your stomach, you may be more likely to develop stomach cancer.</p>\n<p>This can include surgery to remove part of your stomach (known as a partial gastrectomy), surgery to remove part of your vagus nerve (the nerve that carries information from your brain to organs such as your heart, lungs and digestive system), or surgery to repair a stomach ulcer.</p>\n<h2>How stomach cancer spreads</h2>\n<p>There are 3 ways stomach cancer can spread:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>directly &ndash;&nbsp;the cancer can spread from the stomach into nearby tissues and organs, such as the pancreas, colon, small intestine and peritoneum (the lining of the inside of the abdominal cavity)</li>\n<li>through&nbsp;the lymphatic system &ndash; the lymphatic system is a series of glands (nodes) located throughout your body, similar to the blood circulatory system; the glands produce specialised cells needed by your immune system to fight infection</li>\n<li>through&nbsp;the blood &ndash;&nbsp;which can cause the cancer to spread from the stomach to other parts of the body, most commonly the liver</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Diagnosing stomach cancer</h2>\n<div>\n<p>See your GP as soon as possible if you have stomach cancer symptoms such as indigestion, unexpected weight loss, anaemia and persistent vomiting.</p>\n<p>Your GP will ask about your symptoms and examine your stomach for any lumpiness or tenderness. If they think that stomach cancer may be a possibility they\'ll refer you to a specialist for further investigation.</p>\n<p>In 2015, the&nbsp;<a>National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)</a>&nbsp;published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and&nbsp;<a>symptoms of stomach cancer</a>&nbsp;and refer people for the right tests faster.&nbsp;Find out&nbsp;<a>who should be referred for further tests for suspected stomach cancer</a>.</p>\n<h2>Hospital tests</h2>\n<p>If your GP thinks you may have stomach cancer, they\'ll refer you to a specialist for tests.</p>\n<p>These may include a&nbsp;<a>blood test</a>&nbsp;and chest&nbsp;<a>X-ray</a>, which will assess your overall health. A sample of your stools may also be tested for blood.</p>\n<p>Because of&nbsp;the potentially serious nature of stomach cancer, you should be referred to the specialist within two weeks. Read more about&nbsp;<a>waiting times</a>.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;main tests&nbsp;used to diagnose stomach cancer are outlined below.</p>\n<h3>Endoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound</h3>\n<p>An endoscopy is a procedure where the inside of your body is examined using a piece of equipment called an endoscope (a long, thin flexible tube with a light and a video camera at the end).</p>\n<p>If you need to have an endoscopy, you won\'t be able to eat or drink for four to eight hours before the procedure. This is to ensure your stomach and duodenum (top of the small intestine) are empty.</p>\n<p>You\'ll be awake during the endoscopy, but may be given a sedative by injection to make you feel drowsy and relaxed. A&nbsp;<a>local anaesthetic</a>&nbsp;may also be sprayed onto the back of your throat, so the area is numbed.</p>\n<p>The endoscope will be passed down your gullet (food pipe) and into your stomach so the specialist can look for any&nbsp;<a>stomach ulcers</a>&nbsp;or signs of cancer. If tissue is found that may be cancerous, a sample will be taken for testing. This procedure is known as a&nbsp;<a>biopsy</a>. The sample will be examined under a microscope in a laboratory. The results will show whether the cells are cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign) and will usually take 7 to 10 days to come back.</p>\n<p>The endoscopy itself usually takes about 15 minutes, although you should allow about 2 hours in total for your visit.</p>\n<p>If your specialist thinks you may have cancer in the top part of your stomach, you may have an&nbsp;<a>ultrasound scan</a>&nbsp;at the same time as an endoscopy. This is known as an endoscopic ultrasound and uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of your stomach (this method is commonly used to view an unborn baby in the womb).</p>\n<p>If you have an endoscopic ultrasound, an ultrasound probe will be attached to the end of the endoscope before it\'s passed down your throat. The scan will help determine the stage of any cancer in the top part of your stomach.</p>\n<p>After an endoscopy, or an endoscopic ultrasound, you won\'t be able to drive for several hours because of the sedative. You may also have a&nbsp;<a>sore throat</a>, although this should pass within a few days.</p>\n<h3>Barium meal X-ray</h3>\n<p>A barium meal X-ray or barium swallow involves drinking a chalky liquid containing a substance called barium, which makes your stomach show up on an X-ray. Nowadays, however, it\'s less commonly used to diagnose stomach cancers.</p>\n<p>Organs such as your stomach don\'t usually show up on an X-ray because they\'re made of soft tissue that isn\'t dense enough to stop the X-rays passing through. However, when these organs are filled with barium, it blocks the X-rays and shows up white on an X-ray screen.</p>\n<p>You won\'t able to eat or drink for at least 6 hours before the procedure because your stomach and duodenum need to be empty. You may be given an injection to relax the muscles in your digestive system.</p>\n<p>A barium swallow usually takes about 15 minutes. Afterwards, you\'ll be able to eat and drink as normal, although you may need to drink more water to help flush the barium out of your system. You may feel slightly sick, and the barium may cause&nbsp;<a>constipation</a>. Your stools may be white for a few days afterwards as the barium passes through your system.</p>\n<h2>Further testing</h2>\n<p>If you\'re diagnosed with stomach cancer, further tests may be needed to help determine how far it\'s spread and how quickly it\'s likely to spread (known as the stage and grade). Your cancer specialist (oncologist) will discuss this with you.</p>\n<p>However, it may not always be possible to identify the exact stage of your condition until your treatment starts.</p>\n<h3>Laparoscopy</h3>\n<p>Your specialist may need to examine your stomach in more detail to see if the cancer has spread, particularly to the lining of the abdominal cavity (peritoneum). If it has, you may need to have a small operation called a laparoscopy. This procedure is carried out under a&nbsp;<a>general anaesthetic</a>, so you\'ll be unconscious during it.</p>\n<p>During the procedure, a thin viewing tube with a camera at the end (a laparoscope) will be inserted into your stomach through a small incision in the lower part of your tummy. In some cases, your specialist may need to examine more than one area of your stomach and make more than one incision.</p>\n<h3>Computerised tomography or positron emission tomography scans</h3>\n<p>During&nbsp;<a>CT scans</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>PET scans</a>, a series of X-ray images of your body are taken. A computer is then used to put the images together and create a detailed picture of the inside of your body.</p>\n<p>These scans will help your doctor assess how advanced your cancer is. It allows them to see whether the cancerous cells have formed tumours anywhere else in the body. The scans can also&nbsp;help your doctors work out which type of treatment will be most effective and appropriate for you.</p>\n<h3>Liver ultrasound scan</h3>\n<p>If your specialist thinks your stomach cancer may have spread to your liver, you may need to have a liver&nbsp;<a>ultrasound</a>. This type of scan uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of your liver.</p>\n<h2>Staging and grading</h2>\n<p>After all of the tests have been completed and your test results are known, it should be possible to tell what stage and grade of stomach cancer you have.</p>\n<p>Staging is a measurement of how far cancer has spread. There are a number of different ways stomach cancer can be staged.&nbsp;One method uses a numbering system from 1 to 4. The higher the number, the further the cancer has spread.</p>\n<p>The majority of stomach cancers are at stage 3 or 4 when diagnosed, which means a cure isn\'t&nbsp;usually possible.</p>\n<p>Grading describes how quickly the cancer is likely to spread in the future. There are 3 grades of stomach cancer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>low-grade &ndash; the cancer tends to grow slowly</li>\n<li>medium-grade &ndash; the cancer grows a bit&nbsp;faster</li>\n<li>high-grade &ndash; the cancer is aggressive and likely to grow quickly</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Treating stomach cancer</h2>\n<div class=\"editor\">\n<p>The treatments recommended for stomach cancer will depend on your general health and how far the cancer has spread.</p>\n<p>Most hospitals use multidisciplinary teams made up of a number of different specialists (see below) who work together to plan and carry out&nbsp;the best treatment, tailored to your circumstances.</p>\n<p>Feel free to discuss treatment with your care team at any time and ask questions.</p>\n<h2>Your treatment plan</h2>\n<p>The main treatments for stomach cancer are surgery,&nbsp;<a>chemotherapy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a>radiotherapy</a>. You may have one of these treatments or a combination.</p>\n<p>If surgery is recommended, you may have chemotherapy beforehand. If the tumour is in the upper part of your stomach, including the junction between the oesophagus and stomach, you may also have radiotherapy prior to surgery.</p>\n<p>Surgery is mainly used if stomach cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, whereas chemotherapy and radiotherapy tend to be used when the condition is diagnosed at a later stage.</p>\n<p>Where possible, the primary aim of treatment is to completely&nbsp;remove the tumour and any other cancerous cells in your body.&nbsp;It\'s estimated that a cure is possible in 20-30% of stomach cancer cases.</p>\n<p>If it\'s not possible to remove the tumour, your doctors will focus on trying to prevent it from getting any bigger and causing further harm to your body. This may be done using surgery or chemotherapy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In some cases, it\'s not possible to eliminate the cancer or slow it down. In this case, your treatment will aim to relieve your symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible, usually with surgery or radiotherapy.</p>\n<p>A relatively new medication called&nbsp;trastuzumab (see below) can also be used to treat some types of advanced stomach cancer.</p>\n<p>Your healthcare team will talk to you about which treatments are most suitable.</p>\n<h2>Surgery</h2>\n<p>If you\'re diagnosed with stomach cancer at an early stage,&nbsp;it may be possible for the cancer to be completely removed during surgery.</p>\n<p>In some cases, it may be possible to pass a thin, flexible tube (endoscope) down your oesophagus (gullet),&nbsp;rather than making incisions in your tummy. This is known as endoscopic surgery, and can be used to&nbsp;remove a sample of the tumour for testing (<a>biopsy</a>). It can also be used to remove the tumour completely if stomach cancer is diagnosed at an early stage.</p>\n<p>However, if your cancer has spread beyond your stomach, it may not be possible to remove it completely. If this is the case, you may still have surgery to remove any cancer blocking your stomach, to ease your symptoms. This will depend on whether your symptoms can be controlled and the risks and side effects of undertaking major surgery.</p>\n<p>Any type of surgery for stomach cancer will involve a large operation and a long recovery time. If you have stomach cancer surgery, you\'ll usually need to stay in hospital for around 2 weeks. You\'ll also need several weeks at home to recover.</p>\n<h3>Surgery to remove your stomach</h3>\n<p>You may&nbsp;need to have part or all of your stomach removed.</p>\n<p>Surgery to remove part of your stomach is known as a partial or sub-total gastrectomy, and surgery to remove all of your stomach is known as a total gastrectomy. In some cases, your surgeon may remove part of your oesophagus as well as all of&nbsp;your stomach, using&nbsp;a procedure known as an oesophagogastrectomy.</p>\n<p>These operations may be carried out&nbsp;using either a large incision in your tummy (open surgery), or a number of smaller incisions through which surgical tools can be passed (laparoscopic or keyhole surgery). Both of these techniques are carried out under&nbsp;<a>general anaesthetic</a>, which means you\'ll be unconscious throughout the procedure.</p>\n<p>During these operations, your surgeon will also remove the lymph nodes (small glands that help fight infection) nearest to the cancer. It\'s possible that your stomach cancer may have spread to these lymph nodes, and removing them helps prevent the cancer returning.</p>\n<h3>Partial gastrectomy</h3>\n<p>If your cancer is in the lower part of your stomach, you may have a partial gastrectomy&nbsp;to&nbsp;remove it.</p>\n<p>After surgery, your stomach will be smaller than it was before the operation. However, the top part of your stomach, where your oesophagus feeds into it, won\'t be affected.</p>\n<h3>Total gastrectomy or oesophagogastrectomy</h3>\n<p>If your cancer is in the middle or at the top of your stomach, you may need to have a total gastrectomy. If the cancer is close to the end of your oesophagus, where it meets your stomach, you may&nbsp;need to have an oesophagogastrectomy.</p>\n<p>If you have a total gastrectomy, the end of your gullet will be joined to the top of your jejunum (the top part of your small intestine). If you have an oesophagogastrectomy, the remaining part of your gullet will be joined to your jejunum.</p>\n<h3>Surgery to ease your symptoms</h3>\n<p>If your stomach cancer has spread beyond your stomach, it may not be possible to remove it using surgery.</p>\n<p>However, if your stomach has been significantly affected by cancer it can cause a blockage, which prevents food from being properly digested. A blocked stomach can cause symptoms such as stomach pain, vomiting and feeling very full after eating.</p>\n<p>If your stomach is blocked, there are a few options:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>stenting &ndash; a stent is a plastic or wire mesh tube inserted through the oesophagus using an endoscope under&nbsp;<a>local anaesthetic</a>; after being inserted, the stent will be expanded and open up the stomach&nbsp;</li>\n<li>partial or total gastrectomy &ndash; to remove the blockage and improve your symptoms</li>\n<li>bypass surgery &ndash; an operation where part of your stomach above the blockage is joined to your&nbsp;small intestine, leaving the blocked part of your stomach out of your digestive system</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Chemotherapy</h2>\n<p>Chemotherapy is a specialist treatment for cancer that uses medicines, called cytotoxic medicines,&nbsp;to stop cancer cells dividing and multiplying. As it circulates through your body, the medicine can target cancer cells in your stomach and any that may have spread to other parts of your body.</p>\n<p>You may have chemotherapy for stomach cancer before surgery to reduce the amount of cancer that has to be removed during the operation. Chemotherapy can also be used after surgery to destroy any remaining cancer cells and prevent the cancer from coming back.</p>\n<p>Chemotherapy can also help to slow the progression of cancer and ease the symptoms of more advanced stomach cancer, which may not be suitable for surgery.</p>\n<p>If may be given orally (as tablets) or intravenously (by injection or a drip through a vein directly into your bloodstream), or a combination of both.</p>\n<p>Intravenous chemotherapy is usually given in hospital, while oral chemotherapy is taken at home. Chemotherapy is often given in cycles, each usually lasting about three weeks.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, chemotherapy may be administered through a small pump, which gives you a constant low dose over a few weeks or months. The pumps are portable and can be worn at home, which means fewer trips to hospital.</p>\n<h3>Side effects of chemotherapy</h3>\n<p>Chemotherapy works by preventing cancerous cells from growing rapidly. However, it also destroys non-cancerous cells such as&nbsp;hair follicles and red and white blood cells. Side effects may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>tiredness</li>\n<li>nausea and vomiting</li>\n<li>nerve damage (<a>peripheral neuropathy</a>)</li>\n<li><a>hair loss</a></li>\n<li><a>diarrhoea</a>&nbsp;</li>\n<li><a>anaemia</a>&nbsp;(a lack of red blood cells)</li>\n<li>weight loss</li>\n<li>skin changes &ndash; such as redness, swelling and a tingling sensation in the palms of the hands and/or soles of the feet</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The side effects you experience after having chemotherapy will depend on the type of chemotherapy and the number of treatment sessions you need. You\'ll be told who to contact if you\'re experiencing serious side effects from chemotherapy, and it\'s very important that this contact information is recorded carefully.</p>\n<p>If you experience nausea and vomiting as a result of chemotherapy, you may be able to take anti-sickness medication to counter it. This may be given intravenously (by injection directly into your bloodstream) at the same time as your chemotherapy.</p>\n<p>The side effects of chemotherapy will only last for as long as your course of treatment lasts. Once your treatment is over, the&nbsp;hair follicles&nbsp;and blood cells&nbsp;will repair themselves. This means your hair will grow back, although it might look or feel different from how it did before chemotherapy (for example, it may be a slightly different colour, or be softer or curlier than before).</p>\n<h2>Radiotherapy</h2>\n<p>Radiotherapy uses beams of high energy&nbsp;<a>radiation</a>&nbsp;to destroy cancer cells. It\'s not often used to treat stomach cancer because there\'s a risk that other organs close to your stomach might be damaged by the treatment.</p>\n<p>However, if you have advanced stomach cancer that\'s causing pain or bleeding,&nbsp;you may need to have radiotherapy. In some cases, following surgery, you may have chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy to help prevent the stomach cancer from recurring.</p>\n<p>If a cancer is bleeding slowly and causing&nbsp;<a>anaemia</a>, a single fraction of radiotherapy can be used to try to prevent further bleeding.</p>\n<p>If you need radiotherapy, your treatment will usually begin 2 or 3 months after surgery or chemotherapy, to give your body a chance to recover. This is a painless procedure where you lie under a radiotherapy machine while it directs radiation at your stomach. You\'ll be positioned by a radiographer (a specialist in radiotherapy) so that the machine targets the cancer cells and avoids as much healthy tissue as possible.</p>\n<p>Radiotherapy often involves having treatment sessions 5 days a week. Each session will only last a few minutes. The radiation doesn\'t stay in your system afterwards, and it\'s perfectly safe to be around others between your treatments.</p>\n<p>How long you\'ll need to have radiotherapy for will depend on how it\'s used. Radiotherapy used after surgery to help prevent stomach cancer coming back usually lasts 5 weeks. If it\'s being used to control symptoms of advanced stomach cancer, it may only last 1 or 2 weeks.</p>\n<h3>Side effects of radiotherapy</h3>\n<p>You may experience the following side effects after having radiotherapy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>tiredness</li>\n<li>nausea</li>\n<li>diarrhoea</li>\n<li>irritation and darkening of your skin where the treatment takes place</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These side effects will usually improve within a few weeks of treatment finishing.</p>\n<h2>Trastuzumab</h2>\n<p>Trastuzumab&nbsp;(sold under the brand name Herceptin) is a medication&nbsp;used to treat&nbsp;<a>breast cancer</a>&nbsp;and some cases of advanced stomach cancer.</p>\n<p>Some stomach cancers are stimulated by a type of protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Trastuzumab works by blocking the effects of this protein. This doesn\'t cure stomach cancer, but&nbsp;it can slow its growth and increase survival time.</p>\n<p>If you\'re diagnosed with advanced stomach cancer and tests show high levels of the HER2 protein in the cancerous cells, your doctors may recommend treatment with a combination of chemotherapy and trastuzumab.</p>\n<p>Trastuzumab is given intravenously, through a drip, and you\'ll have the treatment in hospital. Each treatment session takes up to 1 hour and you\'ll usually need a session once every 3 weeks.</p>\n<p>Trastuzumab can cause side effects, including heart problems. Therefore, it may not be suitable if you have a heart problem such as&nbsp;<a>angina</a>, uncontrolled high blood pressure (<a>hypertension</a>) or heart valve disease. If you need to take trastuzumab, you\'ll also need regular tests on your heart to check for any problems.</p>\n<p>Other side effects of trastuzumab may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>an initial allergic reaction to the medication, which can cause nausea, wheezing, chills and fever</li>\n<li>diarrhoea</li>\n<li>tiredness</li>\n<li>aches and pains</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Living with stomach cancer</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Being diagnosed with cancer is a tough challenge for most people, but support is available to help you cope.</p>\n<p>You may find the following&nbsp;advice helpful:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>keep talking to your friends and family&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;they can be a powerful support system</li>\n<li>talk to others in the same situation</li>\n<li>research your condition</li>\n<li>set reasonable goals</li>\n<li>take time out for yourself</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cancer charities, such as&nbsp;<a>Macmillan Cancer Support</a>, are a good source of information and support.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h3>Recovery</h3>\n<p>Getting back to normal after surgery can take time. It\'s important to take things slowly and give yourself time to recover. During your recovery,&nbsp;avoid lifting heavy things such as children or shopping bags, and strenuous tasks such as housework. You may also be advised not to drive.</p>\n<p>Some other treatments, particularly&nbsp;<a>chemotherapy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a>radiotherapy</a>, can make you very tired. You may need to take a break from some of your normal activities for a while. Don\'t be afraid to ask for practical help from family and friends.</p>\n<h3>Follow-up</h3>\n<p>After your treatment has finished, you\'ll be invited for regular check-ups, usually every three months for the first year. During the check-up, your doctor will examine you and may arrange&nbsp;<a>blood tests</a>&nbsp;or scans to see how you\'re responding to treatment.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h3>Diet after surgery&nbsp;</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>If you\'ve had an operation to remove part of your stomach (partial gastrectomy), you\'ll only be able to eat small amounts of food for a while after your operation. This is because your stomach won\'t be able to hold as much food as it could before the surgery, and your body will need to adjust to its new stomach capacity. You should gradually be able to increase the amount you eat as your stomach begins to expand.</p>\n<p>If you\'ve had surgery to remove all of your stomach (total gastrectomy), it may be some time before you can eat normally again. As with a partial gastrectomy, you\'ll only be able to eat small amounts of food until your body adjusts. You may have to eat little and often, and make changes to the types of food you eat. Your care team will be able to advise you about what and when you should eat.</p>\n<p>Having surgery to remove your stomach also means you\'ll need to have regular injections of vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 is usually absorbed through your stomach from the food you eat and is needed to help prevent&nbsp;a condition called&nbsp;<a>anaemia</a>&nbsp;and nerve problems.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div >\n<h4>Looking after yourself</h4>\n<p>Eat regularly and healthily. You may not have time to sit down for every meal, but you should make time to do so at least once a day.</p>\n<p>It\'s understandable if there are times when you feel resentful, and then guilty for feeling so. You may also feel exhausted, isolated and worry about the person you care for.&nbsp;Remember: you\'re human, and those feelings are natural.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div >\n<h3>Dealing with dying</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>If your stomach cancer can\'t be cured, your GP will give you support and any necessary pain relief (often alongside chemotherapy or radiotherapy, which can be used to reduce your symptoms).&nbsp;This is called&nbsp;<a>palliative care</a>.&nbsp;Support is also available for your family and friends</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(137,136,NULL,NULL,'<h1>Vaginal cancer:</h1>\n<h2>Causes of vaginal cancer</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Cancer occurs when the cells in a certain area of your body divide and multiply too rapidly. This produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour.</p>\n<p>The exact&nbsp;reason why this happens in cases&nbsp;of vaginal cancer is unknown, but certain things can&nbsp;increase your chances of developing the condition.</p>\n<h2>Human papilloma virus (HPV)</h2>\n<p>Human papilloma virus (HPV) is the name given to a&nbsp;group of viruses that affect the skin and the moist membranes that line the body, such as those in the cervix, anus, mouth and throat. HPV is spread during sex, including anal and oral sex.</p>\n<p>There are many different types of HPV and up to 8&nbsp;out of every 10 people are infected with&nbsp;the&nbsp;virus&nbsp;at some time during their lives. In most cases, the virus goes away without causing any harm and doesn\'t lead to vaginal cancer.</p>\n<p>However, HPV is present in&nbsp;more than&nbsp;two-thirds of women with vaginal cancer, which suggests that it may increase your risk of developing the condition.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>HPV is known to cause changes in the cells of the cervix, which can lead to&nbsp;<a>cervical cancer</a>. It\'s thought that the virus could have a similar effect on the cells of the vagina (see below).</p>\n<h2>Abnormal cells in the cervix or vagina</h2>\n<p>You\'re more likely to develop vaginal cancer if you\'ve previously been found to have abnormal cells in your:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>cervix&nbsp;&ndash; known as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)</li>\n<li>vagina&nbsp;&ndash; known as&nbsp;vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>CIN and VAIN are terms used to describe cells that are abnormal, but not different enough to be considered cancerous. Both are thought to be closely linked to having a persistent HPV infection.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;abnormal cells&nbsp;don\'t&nbsp;usually cause any problems themselves and&nbsp;may only be detected during&nbsp;<a>cervical screening</a>, but left untreated there is a small chance they could eventually become cancerous.</p>\n<p>If you\'re found to have CIN or VAIN, a procedure to remove or destroy the abnormal cells may be recommended.</p>\n<h2>Diethylstilbestrol</h2>\n<p>A medicine called diethylstilbestrol is known to increase your risk of vaginal cancer. The medication&nbsp;was widely prescribed for pregnant women between 1938&nbsp;and 1971, because it was thought it&nbsp;could help reduce the risk of&nbsp;<a>miscarriage</a>.</p>\n<p>However, in 1971, researchers discovered a link between diethylstilbestrol and cancer in the children of women given the medicine.&nbsp;The use of diethylstilbestrol in pregnant women was then banned.</p>\n<p>The risk of vaginal cancer associated with&nbsp;diethylstilbestrol is small and as it\'s now&nbsp;over 40 years since it was last&nbsp;used during pregnancies, cases of vaginal cancer linked to the medication are very rare.</p>\n<h2>Other possible factors</h2>\n<p>Other things that may increase your risk of vaginal cancer include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>your age &ndash; 7&nbsp;out of every 10 cases of vaginal cancer occur in women over 60 and the condition is extremely rare in women under 40</li>\n<li>having a history of reproductive cancers, such as&nbsp;<a >cervical cancer</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>vulval cancer</a>&nbsp;&ndash; particularly if you were treated&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a>radiotherapy</a></li>\n<li>smoking</li>\n<li>having&nbsp;<a>HIV</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Diagnosing vaginal cancer</h2>\n<div>\n<p>To help diagnose vaginal cancer, your GP will ask you about your symptoms and may carry out a physical examination.</p>\n<p>They may also refer you for&nbsp;<a>blood tests</a>&nbsp;to rule out other causes of your symptoms, such as infection.</p>\n<p>If your GP cannot find an obvious cause of your symptoms, they will probably refer you to a gynaecologist for further testing. A gynaecologist is a specialist in treating conditions of the female reproductive system.</p>\n<p>If your GP refers you urgently because they think you have cancer, you have the right to be seen by a specialist within 2&nbsp;weeks. Read more about&nbsp;<a>NHS waiting times</a>.</p>\n<p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (<a href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/\">NICE</a>) recommends that GPs consider referring a woman who has an unexplained mass in or at the entrance to their vagina.</p>\n<h2>Seeing a gynaecologist</h2>\n<p>If you are referred to a gynaecologist, you may have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>external and internal vaginal examinations to look for any unusual lumps or swellings</li>\n<li>a&nbsp;<a>colposcopy</a>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;an examination where a special instrument (colposcope) that acts like a magnifying glass is used to study your vagina in greater detail</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your&nbsp;gynaecologist thinks there may be abnormal tissue inside your vagina, a small sample of the tissue will be removed and checked under a microscope for cancerous cells. This is known as a&nbsp;<a>biopsy</a>.</p>\n<p>If the results of the biopsy suggest you have cancer, you&nbsp;may have further tests to see if the cancer has spread.</p>\n<p>These tests may include a more&nbsp;detailed internal vaginal examination carried out under&nbsp;<a>general anaesthetic</a>,&nbsp;<a >X-rays</a>,&nbsp;<a>computerised tomography (CT) scans</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a >magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans</a>.</p>\n<h2>Staging</h2>\n<p>Healthcare professionals use a staging system to describe how far vaginal cancer has advanced.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>stage 1&nbsp;&ndash; the cancer has started to grow into the wall of the vagina</li>\n<li>stage 2&nbsp;&ndash; the cancer has begun to spread outside the vagina into the surrounding tissues</li>\n<li>stage 3&nbsp;&ndash; the cancer has spread into your pelvis and may have spread to nearby lymph nodes</li>\n<li>stage 4a&nbsp;&ndash; the cancer has spread beyond your vagina and into organs such as your bladder or back passage (rectum)</li>\n<li>stage 4b&nbsp;&ndash; the cancer has spread into organs further away, such as the lungs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The stage of your cancer is important in determining which treatment is most appropriate and whether a cure is possible. Generally, the lower the stage when cancer is diagnosed, the better the chance of a cure.</p>\n<p>If a cure is not possible, treatment can still help&nbsp;relieve&nbsp;any symptoms and slow down the spread of the cancer. Read more about&nbsp;<a >how vaginal cancer is treated</a>.</p>\n<h2>Treating vaginal cancer</h2>\n<div>\n<p>Treatment for vaginal cancer will depend on where the cancer is in your vagina and how far it has spread. Possible treatments include radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy.</p>\n<p>When you are diagnosed with cancer, you will be cared for by a group of different healthcare professionals, known as a multidisciplinary team (MDT).</p>\n<p>Your MDT will include a range of specialists, including surgeons, clinical oncologists (specialists in the non-surgical treatment of cancer), and&nbsp;specialist cancer nurses.</p>\n<p>Your MDT will recommend a treatment plan they feel is most suitable for you, but the final decision will be yours.</p>\n<p>Before going to hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions to ask the specialist. For example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.</p>\n<h2>Radiotherapy</h2>\n<p><a>Radiotherapy</a>&nbsp;is the main treatment for vaginal cancer. It can be used:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>as an initial treatment to cure the cancer</li>\n<li>in combination with chemotherapy (chemoradiation)</li>\n<li>after surgery to prevent the cancer from returning</li>\n<li>to control symptoms when a cure is not possible (palliative radiotherapy)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How it\'s carried out</h3>\n<p>There are 2&nbsp;main ways that radiotherapy for vaginal cancer can be given:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>external radiotherapy &ndash;&nbsp;a machine beams high-energy rays at your vagina and pelvis</li>\n<li>internal radiotherapy &ndash; a small radioactive device, which looks like a tampon, is inserted into your vagina</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The type of radiotherapy you receive depends on where the cancer is in your body. For example, internal radiotherapy may be used if the cancer is in the lining of your vagina, and external radiotherapy may be used if the cancer is deeper in the tissues of the vagina. Many women receive a combination of internal and external radiotherapy.</p>\n<p>External radiotherapy is usually given for around 4&nbsp;to 6&nbsp;weeks in short daily sessions, from Monday to Friday. You return home between treatments and have a break&nbsp;at the weekends.</p>\n<p>Internal radiotherapy may involve either a long treatment session where you need to stay in hospital for 24 hours, or several short day-case treatments.</p>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;<a>how radiotherapy is performed</a>.</p>\n<h3>Side effects</h3>\n<p>Following radiotherapy, it\'s likely you will have some side effects. These occur because radiotherapy temporarily damages some healthy cells as well as destroying cancerous ones.</p>\n<p>Possible side effects of radiotherapy for vaginal cancer include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sore, red skin&nbsp;&ndash; similar to&nbsp;<a>sunburn</a></li>\n<li>vaginal discharge</li>\n<li>pain while passing urine</li>\n<li><a >diarrhoea</a></li>\n<li>tiredness</li>\n<li>feeling sick&nbsp;</li>\n<li>narrowing of the vagina (see below)</li>\n<li>early menopause and infertility (see below)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read more about the&nbsp;<a>side effects of radiotherapy</a>.</p>\n<h3>Effects on sex</h3>\n<p>Radiotherapy may cause you to lose interest in sex, particularly if you have side effects such as tiredness or nausea, or you are anxious about your condition or treatment.</p>\n<p>Radiotherapy can also cause scar tissue to form in your vagina, which can make it narrower and means having sex is difficult or uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>If you feel up to it, your care team may suggest having sex regularly during treatment to help stop this happening. Devices called dilators, which are inserted into the vagina, can also be used after treatment stops to help&nbsp;stop your vagina getting narrower.</p>\n<p>You may also experience some&nbsp;vaginal dryness or pain when having sex. If this happens, you can try using lubricants or asking your&nbsp;care team about&nbsp;possible treatments.</p>\n<h3>Menopause and fertility</h3>\n<p>If you have external radiotherapy to your pelvis, you may experience an early&nbsp;<a>menopause</a>&nbsp;(if you have not had the menopause already).</p>\n<p>This means you will no longer be able to have children (infertility). This is&nbsp;can be&nbsp;very upsetting, particularly for younger women who wanted to have children. Before your treatment, your&nbsp;care team will explain whether this is a risk and discuss the options and support&nbsp;available.</p>\n<h2>Surgery</h2>\n<p>There are 4&nbsp;main types of surgery used to treat vaginal cancer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>partial vaginectomy &ndash; removing the upper section of your vagina</li>\n<li>radical vaginectomy &ndash;&nbsp;removing all of your vagina and pelvic lymph nodes</li>\n<li>radical vaginectomy and radical hysterectomy &ndash;&nbsp;removing all of your vagina, womb, ovaries, fallopian tubes and pelvic lymph nodes</li>\n<li>pelvic exenteration &ndash; removing all of your vagina and surrounding tissue, including the bladder and/or rectum (back passage)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Partial vaginectomy</h3>\n<p>A partial vaginectomy can be used to treat&nbsp;stage 1&nbsp;vaginal cancer, when radiotherapy has failed to remove the cancer or where a woman prefers to have surgery rather than radiotherapy because she still wants to have children.</p>\n<p>Your surgeon will remove the cancerous section of the vagina, as well as&nbsp;some surrounding healthy tissue, just in case a small number of cancerous cells have spread.</p>\n<p>Your surgeon will repair the defect in the vaginal wall, which means you will be able to have sex after you have recovered from the operation.</p>\n<h3>Radical vaginectomy</h3>\n<p>A radical vaginectomy&nbsp;may be&nbsp;used to treat cases of advanced stage 1 and stage 2 vaginal cancer. The surgeon will remove most, or all, of your vagina.</p>\n<p>A plastic surgeon may be able to make a new vagina using skin, muscle and tissue taken from another part of your body &ndash; usually one of your thighs or buttocks.</p>\n<p>You will still be able to have sex after a vaginal reconstruction, although you will need to use lubricant, because&nbsp;the lining of the new vagina cannot make the mucus it would naturally make.</p>\n<h3>Radical hysterectomy</h3>\n<p>A radical hysterectomy is often&nbsp;performed at the same time as a radical vaginectomy.</p>\n<p>During a radical hysterectomy, all of the reproductive system is removed, including the womb, fallopian tubes, ovaries and nearby lymph nodes.</p>\n<h3>Pelvic exenteration</h3>\n<p>Pelvic exenteration is used in a few cases to treat recurrent or advanced cases of vaginal cancer.</p>\n<p>If&nbsp;you no longer have a bladder, you will need another way to pass urine. One solution is for your surgeon to make a hole (stoma) in your tummy. A bag is then attached to the stoma so that urine can be passed into it. The bag is known as a urostomy bag.</p>\n<p>Similarly, as you&nbsp;may no longer have a rectum, you will need a way to pass stools (faeces) out of your digestive system. Another stoma can be made and attached to a collection bag, known as a colostomy bag.</p>\n<p>Read more about&nbsp;<a>colostomies</a>.</p>\n<p>A vaginal reconstruction can be carried out after&nbsp;a pelvic exenteration. It&nbsp;may also be possible to reconstruct your rectum and attach it to the remaining section of your bowel once this has healed. In this case, you will only need a temporary colostomy.</p>\n<p>As pelvic exenteration is major surgery, it may take you several months to fully recover from the operation.</p>\n<h2>Chemotherapy</h2>\n<p><a>Chemotherapy</a>&nbsp;is usually used in combination with radiotherapy or to control symptoms when a cure is not possible (palliative chemotherapy). It\'s usually given by injection (intravenous chemotherapy).</p>\n<p>Like radiotherapy, the powerful cancer-killing medicines used in chemotherapy can also damage healthy tissue and cause a range of side effects. Side effects of chemotherapy for vaginal cancer can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>tiredness</li>\n<li>feeling sick</li>\n<li>increased risk of infections</li>\n<li>diarrhoea</li>\n<li><a>hair loss</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read more about the&nbsp;<a >side effects of chemotherapy</a>.</p>\n<h2>Coping with treatment</h2>\n<p>Treatment for vaginal cancer can have a significant emotional impact, particularly for young women who experience an early menopause as a result of treatment.</p>\n<p>The removal of some or all of the vagina can be traumatic for pre- and post-menopausal women alike, and&nbsp;some women feel less \"womanly\" than they did before. It\'s not uncommon to feel a sense of loss and bereavement after treatment. In some women, this may lead to&nbsp;<a>depression</a>.</p>\n<p>You may find it helpful to talk to other women who have had similar treatment.

Clinical trials are an important way for healthcare professionals to learn more about the best way to treat specific conditions.</p>\n<p>Most clinical trials involve comparing a new treatment with an existing treatment to determine whether the new treatment is more or less effective. If you do receive a new treatment, there is no guarantee it will be more effective than an existing one.</p>\n<p>You can find out whether there are currently any&nbsp;clinical trials for vaginal cancer, or ask your care team if there are clinical trials in your area. Your care team can explain the advantages and disadvantages of taking part.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(138,137,NULL,NULL,'<h1>Womb (uterus) cancer:</h1>\n<h2>Symptoms of womb cancer</h2>\n<div>\n<p>The most common symptom of womb cancer is abnormal bleeding from the vagina, although most people with abnormal bleeding don\'t have cancer.</p>\n<p>Bleeding may start as light bleeding accompanied by a watery discharge, which may get heavier over time. Most women diagnosed with womb cancer have been through the&nbsp;<a>menopause</a>, so any vaginal bleeding will be unusual.</p>\n<p>In women who haven\'t been through the menopause, unusual vaginal bleeding may consist of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>periods that are heavier than usual</li>\n<li>vaginal bleeding in between normal periods</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Less common symptoms include pain in the lower abdomen (tummy) and pain during sex.</p>\n<p>If womb cancer reaches a more advanced stage, it may cause additional symptoms. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>pain in the back, legs, or pelvis</li>\n<li>loss of appetite</li>\n<li>tiredness</li>\n<li>nausea</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>When to seek medical advice</h2>\n<p>If you have&nbsp;postmenopausal vaginal bleeding, or notice a change in the normal pattern of your period, visit your GP.</p>\n<p>Only&nbsp;1 in 10 cases of unusual vaginal bleeding after the menopause are caused by&nbsp;womb cancer, so it\'s unlikely your symptoms&nbsp;will be caused by this condition.</p>\n<p>However, if you have unusual vaginal bleeding, it\'s important to get the cause of your symptoms investigated.&nbsp;The bleeding may be the result of a number of other potentially serious health conditions, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a >endometriosis</a>&nbsp;&ndash; where tissue that behaves like the lining of the womb is found on the outside of the womb</li>\n<li><a>fibroids</a>&nbsp;&ndash; non-cancerous growths that can develop inside the uterus</li>\n<li>polyps in the womb lining</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other types of gynaecological cancer can also&nbsp;cause unusual&nbsp;vaginal bleeding, particularly&nbsp;<a>cervical cancer</a>.</p>\n<h2>Causes of womb cancer</h2>\n<div>\n<p>It\'s not known exactly what causes womb cancer, but certain things can increase your risk of developing it.</p>\n<p>Cancer begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the DNA in cells, which can affect how they grow. This means cells grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour.</p>\n<p>If left untreated, cancer can grow and spread to other parts of your body, either directly or through the blood and lymphatic system.</p>\n<h2>Increased risk</h2>\n<p>A number of things have been identified that&nbsp;increase the risk of developing&nbsp;womb cancer. Some of these are discussed below.</p>\n<h3>Age</h3>\n<p>The risk of developing&nbsp;womb cancer increases with age. The majority of cases&nbsp;occur in women aged 40 to 74, with only 1% of&nbsp;cases being diagnosed in women under 40.</p>\n<h3>Oestrogen</h3>\n<p>The risk of developing womb cancer is linked to the body\'s&nbsp;exposure to oestrogen. Oestrogen is one of the hormones that regulate the reproductive system in women.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>oestrogen stimulates the release of eggs from your ovaries and causes the cells of the&nbsp;womb lining to divide</li>\n<li>progesterone gets the lining of your uterus ready to receive the egg from the ovaries</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The levels of oestrogen and progesterone in your body are usually balanced with each other. If oestrogen isn\'t kept in balance by progesterone, the level in the body can increase. This is called unopposed oestrogen.</p>\n<p>After the&nbsp;<a>menopause</a>, the body stops producing progesterone. However, there are still small amounts of oestrogen being produced. This unopposed oestrogen causes the cells of the endometrium to divide, which&nbsp;can increase the risk of&nbsp;womb cancer.</p>\n<h3>Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)</h3>\n<p>Because of the link between increased levels of unopposed oestrogen and&nbsp;womb cancer, oestrogen-only&nbsp;<a>hormone replacement therapy (HRT)</a>&nbsp;should only be given to women who have had their womb surgically removed (hysterectomy).</p>\n<p>In all other cases, both oestrogen and progesterone (combination HRT) must be used in HRT to reduce the risk of womb cancer.</p>\n<h3>Being overweight or obese</h3>\n<p>As oestrogen can be produced in fatty tissue, being overweight or obese&nbsp;increases the level of oestrogen in your body. This significantly increases your chances of developing womb cancer.</p>\n<p>Women who are overweight are 3&nbsp;times more likely to develop womb cancer compared with women who are a healthy weight. Very obese women&nbsp;are 6&nbsp;times more likely to develop endometrial cancer compared with women who are a healthy weight.</p>\n<p>One way to assess whether your weight is healthy is to understand&nbsp;<a>your healthy body mass index (BMI)</a>. In the UK, people with a BMI of between 25&nbsp;and 30 are overweight, and those with an index above 30 are obese.</p>\n<h3>Reproductive history</h3>\n<p>Women who have not had children are at a higher risk of&nbsp;womb cancer. This may be because the increased levels of progesterone and decreased levels of oestrogen that occur during&nbsp;<a>pregnancy</a>&nbsp;have a protective effect on the lining of the womb.</p>\n<h3>Tamoxifen</h3>\n<p>Women who are treated with tamoxifen (a hormone treatment for&nbsp;<a>breast cancer</a>) can be at an increased risk of developing womb cancer. However, this risk is outweighed by the benefits that tamoxifen provides in preventing breast cancer.</p>\n<p>It\'s important to visit your GP if you\'re taking tamoxifen and experience any abnormal vaginal bleeding.</p>\n<h3>Diabetes</h3>\n<p>Women&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a>diabetes</a>&nbsp;are twice as likely to develop womb cancer as women without the condition.</p>\n<p>Diabetes causes an increase in the amount of insulin in your body, which in turn can raise your oestrogen levels.</p>\n<p>Many women with type 2 diabetes are also overweight, which further increases the risk.</p>\n<h3>Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)</h3>\n<p>Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) are at a higher risk of developing womb cancer, as they have high levels of oestrogen in their bodies.</p>\n<p>Women with PCOS have multiple cysts in the ovary, which can cause symptoms such as irregular or light periods, or no periods at all, as well as&nbsp;problems getting pregnant, weight gain, acne, and excessive hair growth (hirsutism).</p>\n<h3>Endometrial hyperplasia</h3>\n<p>Endometrial hyperplasia is when the lining of the womb becomes thicker. Women with the condition may be at an increased risk of developing&nbsp;womb cancer.</p>\n<h2>Diagnosing womb cancer</h2>\n<div class=\"editor\">\n<p>You should visit your GP if you have abnormal vaginal bleeding. While it\'s unlikely to be caused by womb cancer, it\'s best to be sure.</p>\n<p>Your GP will probably carry out a physical examination of your pelvic area, including your vagina, womb, ovaries, and bladder. They will ask about your symptoms, when they happen, and how often.</p>\n<p>You may be referred to a specialist in conditions of the female reproductive organs (a gynaecologist) for further tests. Some of these tests are outlined below.</p>\n<p>In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (<a>NICE</a>) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of gynaecological cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected endometrial cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on&nbsp;<a>Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral</a>.</p>\n<h2>Transvaginal ultrasound (TVU)</h2>\n<p>Another test you may have is called a transvaginal ultrasound (TVU). TVU is a type of&nbsp;<a>ultrasound scan</a>&nbsp;that uses a small scanner in the form of a probe.</p>\n<p>This is placed directly into the vagina to obtain a detailed picture of the inside of the uterus. The probe can feel a little uncomfortable, but shouldn\'t be painful.</p>\n<p>The TVU checks whether there are any changes to the thickness of the lining of your uterus that could be caused by the presence of cancerous cells.</p>\n<h2>Biopsy</h2>\n<p>If the results of the TVU detect changes in the thickness of the lining of the uterus, you will usually have a&nbsp;<a>biopsy</a>&nbsp;to confirm the diagnosis.</p>\n<p>In&nbsp;a biopsy, a small sample of cells is taken from the lining of the womb (the endometrium). The sample is then checked at a laboratory for the presence of cancerous cells.</p>\n<p>The biopsy can be carried out in&nbsp;several ways, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>aspiration biopsy &ndash; a small flexible tube is inserted into your vagina and up into your womb, and then sucks up a small sample of cells</li>\n<li>hysteroscopy &ndash; this allows the doctor to look at the inside of the womb using a thin type of telescope called a hysteroscope, which is inserted through your vagina and into your womb, allowing the doctor to look at the lining of the womb and take a sample from it</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In some cases, a&nbsp;<a>hysteroscopy</a>&nbsp;may be used before dilatation and curettage (D&amp;C). D&amp;C is a minor surgical procedure&nbsp;carried out under&nbsp;<a>general anaesthetic</a>,&nbsp;where some tissue from the womb lining is removed. The tissue&nbsp;is then sent off to a laboratory for further testing.</p>\n<h2>Blood test</h2>\n<p>A&nbsp;<a>blood test</a>&nbsp;can sometimes help diagnose womb cancer. This is because some cancerous tumours release certain chemicals into your blood, known as tumour markers, which can be detected during a blood test.</p>\n<p>However, this type of test isn\'t very reliable. The presence of these chemicals doesn\'t mean you definitely have womb cancer. Some people with womb cancer don\'t have these chemicals in their blood.</p>\n<h2>Tests if you have&nbsp;womb cancer</h2>\n<p>If you\'re diagnosed with womb cancer, you may have further tests&nbsp;to help determine the stage of the cancer. Staging the cancer will allow the doctors to work out how large the cancer is, whether or not it has spread, and the best treatment options for you.</p>\n<p>These tests may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a&nbsp;chest&nbsp;<a>X-ray</a>&nbsp;&ndash; where radiation is used to check if the cancer has spread to the lungs</li>\n<li><a>magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</a>&nbsp;&ndash; where magnetic fields are used to create a&nbsp;detailed image of the inside of your body&nbsp;to check if the cancer has spread</li>\n<li>a&nbsp;<a>computerised tomography (CT) scan</a>&nbsp;&ndash; where a series of X-rays are used to create a detailed image of the inside of your body&nbsp;to check if the cancer has spread</li>\n<li>further blood tests &ndash;&nbsp;these are usually done&nbsp;to check your general health and how well some of your organs are functioning</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Treating womb cancer</h2>\n<div>\n<h2>Stages of womb cancer</h2>\n<p>Health professionals use a staging system to describe how far womb cancer has advanced. These stages are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>stage 1 &ndash;&nbsp;the cancer is still contained inside the womb (uterus)</li>\n<li>stage 2 &ndash; the cancer has spread to the neck of the womb (the cervix)</li>\n<li>stage 3 &ndash;&nbsp;the cancer has spread outside the womb into nearby tissues in the pelvis or the lymph nodes</li>\n<li>stage 4 &ndash;&nbsp;the cancer has spread to the soft tissues of the abdomen, or into other organs, such as the bladder, bowel, liver, or lungs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your chances of surviving womb cancer depend on the stage at which it\'s diagnosed.</p>\n<p>If womb cancer is diagnosed at stage 1, the outlook is good and around 95% of women live for at least 5&nbsp;more years.&nbsp;Many women with stage 1 womb cancer are cured.</p>\n<p>If womb cancer is diagnosed at stage 2, you have around a 77% chance of living at least 5&nbsp;more years.</p>\n<p>If the condition is diagnosed at stage 3, you have a 40% chance of living at least another 5&nbsp;years.</p>\n<p>Around 1&nbsp;in 4&nbsp;womb cancers are diagnosed at stage 4. By this point, you only have a 15% chance of living at least 5&nbsp;more years.</p>\n<h2>Treatment overview</h2>\n<p>The main treatment for womb cancer is to remove the womb (hysterectomy), together with the ovaries and fallopian tubes. This is sometimes followed by radiotherapy or chemotherapy&nbsp;to try to kill any possible remaining cancer cells, depending on the stage and grade of the cancer.</p>\n<h2>Treatment for women who haven\'t been through the menopause</h2>\n<p>Having a hysterectomy means you will&nbsp;no longer be&nbsp;able to get pregnant. Younger women who haven\'t already reached the&nbsp;<a>menopause</a>&nbsp;may not want to have their womb and ovaries removed if they wish to have children.</p>\n<p>In this case, under very specific circumstances it may be possible to treat the cancer using hormone therapy.</p>\n<h2>Treating advanced cancer</h2>\n<p>Advanced womb cancer&nbsp;requires a different course of treatment, usually depending more on chemotherapy.</p>\n<p>Advanced cancer may not be curable, but the treatment aims to achieve a remission, where the cancer shrinks, making you feel normal and able to enjoy life to the full.</p>\n<p>Even if there\'s no chance of a cure, surgery may be carried out to remove as much of the cancer as possible.</p>\n<p>Radiotherapy, chemotherapy or hormone therapy can reduce symptoms such as pain by shrinking the cancer or slowing its growth.</p>\n<h2>Surgery</h2>\n<h3>Surgery for stage&nbsp;1&nbsp;womb cancer</h3>\n<p>If you have stage&nbsp;1 cancer, you\'ll probably have a hysterectomy. This involves removing both ovaries and the fallopian tubes in a procedure called a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), as well as&nbsp;the uterus (hysterectomy).</p>\n<p>The surgeon may also take samples from the lymph nodes in the pelvis and abdomen and other nearby tissue. These will be sent to the laboratory to see whether the cancer has spread.</p>\n<p>The most common hysterectomy technique involves using one large cut across your tummy to access the womb and remove it.</p>\n<p>It\'s sometimes possible to use a technique called a laparoscopic hysterectomy, also known as a&nbsp;keyhole hysterectomy. This involves using several small cuts so a special type of telescope (laparoscope) and other surgical instruments&nbsp;can be used.</p>\n<p>This&nbsp;means the surgeon&nbsp;can see inside your body and remove your womb through your vagina with little scarring.</p>\n<p>You\'ll probably be ready to go home 3&nbsp;to 5&nbsp;days after your operation, or less if you had keyhole surgery. But it can take many weeks to recover fully.</p>\n<p>After your operation, you\'ll be encouraged to start moving about as soon as possible. This is very important, and even if you have to stay in bed you\'ll need to keep doing regular leg movements to help your circulation and prevent blood clots. You\'ll be shown exercises by the nurses or physiotherapist to help prevent complications.</p>\n<p>When you go home, you\'ll need to exercise gently to build up your strength and fitness. Discuss with your doctor or physiotherapist which types of exercise would be suitable for you.</p>\n<h3>Surgery for stage&nbsp;2 or 3&nbsp;womb cancer</h3>\n<p>If you have stage&nbsp;2 or&nbsp;3 womb cancer and the cancer has spread to the cervix or nearby lymph nodes in the pelvis, you may have a radical or total hysterectomy.</p>\n<p>This involves the additional removal of the cervix and the top of your vagina, as well as the removal of the pelvic lymph nodes. You may also need radiotherapy or chemotherapy treatment after surgery to reduce the risk&nbsp;of the cancer returning.</p>\n<h3>Surgery for advanced cancer (stage 4)</h3>\n<p>If you have advanced womb cancer, you may have surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible. This is called debulking surgery.</p>\n<p>This won\'t cure the cancer, but it may ease some of the symptoms. Your doctor will discuss whether debulking surgery is suitable for you.</p>\n<h2>Radiotherapy</h2>\n<p>A course of&nbsp;<a>radiotherapy</a>&nbsp;will be recommended if your treatment team thinks there\'s a significant risk the cancer could return in the pelvis. Radiotherapy may also be used to slow the spread of cancer when a surgical cure is not possible.</p>\n<p>There are 2&nbsp;types of radiotherapy used to treat&nbsp;womb cancer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>internal radiotherapy (also known as brachytherapy)&nbsp;&ndash; where&nbsp;a plastic tube is inserted inside the uterus and radiation treatment is passed down the tube into the womb</li>\n<li>external radiotherapy &ndash;&nbsp;where&nbsp;a machine is used to deliver pulses of radiation to your pelvis</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A course of external radiotherapy is usually given to you as an outpatient for 5&nbsp;days a week with a break at the weekend. The treatment takes a few minutes. The whole course of radiotherapy may last approximately 4&nbsp;weeks depending on the stage and position of the womb cancer.</p>\n<p>Some women have internal radiotherapy (brachytherapy) as well as external radiotherapy. During brachytherapy, the device that delivers radiation is placed in your vagina.</p>\n<p>There are different types of brachytherapy, involving either low, medium, or high dose rates. With low dose rate methods the radiation is delivered more slowly, so the device has to stay inside you for longer. You\'ll have to stay in hospital while you have the treatment. Your doctor will discuss this with you.</p>\n<p>Radiotherapy has some side effects. Skin in the treated area can become red and sore, and hair loss may occur. Radiotherapy to the pelvic area can affect the bowel and cause sickness and&nbsp;<a>diarrhoea</a>.</p>\n<p>As your course of treatment progresses, you\'re likely to get very tired. Most of these side effects will go away when your treatment finishes, although around 5% of women continue with long-term treatment effects, such as diarrhoea and rectal bleeding.</p>\n<h2>Chemotherapy</h2>\n<p>If you have stage&nbsp;3 or&nbsp;4&nbsp;womb cancer, you may be given a course of&nbsp;<a>chemotherapy</a>. Chemotherapy can be used after surgery to try to prevent the return of the cancer. In cases of advanced cancer, it may be used to slow the spread of the cancer and relieve symptoms.</p>\n<p>Chemotherapy is usually given as an injection into the vein (intravenously). You\'ll usually be able to go home the same day you have chemotherapy, but sometimes you may need a short stay in hospital.</p>\n<p>Chemotherapy is usually given in cycles, with a period of treatment being followed by a period of rest to allow the body to recover.</p>\n<p>Side effects of chemotherapy can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>nausea</li>\n<li>vomiting</li>\n<li><a>hair loss</a>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>fatigue</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is also an increased risk of an infection developing in your bloodstream&nbsp;<a>(sepsis)</a>, as your body\'s ability to fight infection is reduced by chemotherapy.</p>\n<p>The side effects should stop once treatment has finished.</p>\n<h2>Hormone therapy</h2>\n<p>Some&nbsp;womb cancers are affected by the female hormone oestrogen. These cancers may respond to treatment with hormone therapy. Your doctor will discuss&nbsp;whether this is a possible treatment for your&nbsp;womb cancer.</p>\n<p>Hormone therapy&nbsp;usually&nbsp;replaces&nbsp;a hormone called progesterone, which naturally occurs in your body. Artificial progesterone is used and is&nbsp;usually given as tablets.</p>\n<p>It\'s mainly used to treat advanced-stage&nbsp;womb cancers, or cancer that has come back, and can help shrink the tumour and control any symptoms.</p>\n<p>The treatment may have some side effects, including mild nausea, mild muscle cramps, and weight gain. Your doctor will discuss these with you.</p>\n<h2>Clinical trials</h2>\n<p>A lot of progress has been made in the treatment of womb cancer, and more women are living longer with fewer side effects. Some of these advances were discovered through clinical trials,&nbsp;where new treatments and combinations of treatments are compared with standard treatment.</p>\n<p>All cancer clinical trials in the UK are carefully monitored to make sure the trial is worthwhile and safely conducted. Participants in clinical trials often do better overall than those in routine care.</p>\n<p>If you\'re invited to take part in a trial, you\'ll be given an information sheet. If you wish to take part, you\'ll be&nbsp;<a>asked to sign your consent</a>. You\'re always free to refuse or withdraw from a clinical trial without it affecting your care.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(139,138,NULL,NULL,'<p>Few people know, but cryptocurrencies emerged as a side product of another invention.

The reason why is a bit technical and complex, but if you get it, you‘ll know more about cryptocurrencies than most people do. So, let‘s try to make it as easy as possible:</p><p>To realize digital cash you need&nbsp;a payment network with accounts, balances, and transaction. That‘s easy to understand. One major problem every payment network has to solve is to prevent the so-called double spending: to prevent that one entity spends the same amount twice. Usually, this is done by a central server who keeps record about the balances.</p><p>In a decentralized network , you don‘t have this server. So you need every single entity of the network to do this job. Every peer in the network needs to have a list with all transactions to check if future transactions are valid or an attempt to double spend.</p><p>But how can these entities keep a&nbsp;consensus about these records?&nbsp;</p><p>If the peers of the network disagree about only one single, minor balance, everything is broken.

Cryptocurrencies leverage blockchain technology to gain decentralization, transparency, and immutability.</p><p><strong>How miners create coins and confirm transactions</strong></p><p>Let‘s have a look at the mechanism ruling the databases of cryptocurrencies. A cryptocurrency like Bitcoin consists of a network of peers. Every peer has a record of the complete history of all transactions and thus of the balance of every account.</p><p>A transaction is a file that says, “Bob gives X Bitcoin to Alice“ and is signed by Bob‘s private key.

It is no longer forgeable, it can‘t be reversed, it is part of an immutable record of historical transactions: of the so-called blockchain.</p><p>Only miners can confirm transactions.&nbsp;This is their job in a cryptocurrency-network. They take transactions, stamp them as legit and spread them in the network. After a transaction is confirmed by a miner, every node has to add it to its database. It has become part of the blockchain.</p><p>For this job, the miners get rewarded with a token of the cryptocurrency, for example with Bitcoins.

They are called <strong>CRYPTOcurrencies</strong> because the consensus-keeping process is secured by strong cryptography. Cryptocurrencies are built on cryptography. They are not secured by people or by trust, but by math. It is more probable that an asteroid falls on your house than that a bitcoin address is compromised.</p><p>Describing the properties of cryptocurrencies we need to separate between transactional and monetary properties. While most cryptocurrencies share a common set of properties, they are not carved in stone.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(144,143,NULL,NULL,'<p>1)&nbsp;<strong>Irreversible:</strong>&nbsp;After confirmation, a transaction can‘t be reversed. By nobody. And nobody means nobody. Not you, not your bank, not the president of the United States, not Satoshi, not your miner. Nobody. If you send money, you send it. Period. No one can help you, if you sent your funds to a scammer or if a hacker stole them from your computer. There is no safety net.</p><p>2)&nbsp;<strong>Pseudonymous:</strong>&nbsp;Neither transactions nor accounts are connected to real-world identities. You receive Bitcoins on so-called addresses, which are randomly seeming chains of around 30 characters. While it is usually possible to analyze the transaction flow, it is not necessarily possible to connect the real-world identity of users with those addresses.</p><p>3) <strong>Fast and global: </strong>Transactions are propagated nearly instantly in the network and are confirmed in a couple of minutes. Since they happen in a global network of computers they are completely indifferent of your physical location. It doesn‘t matter if I send Bitcoin to my neighbor or to someone on the other side of the world.</p><p>4)&nbsp;<strong>Secure:</strong>&nbsp;Cryptocurrency funds are locked in a public key cryptography system. Only the owner of the private key can send cryptocurrency. Strong cryptography and the magic of big numbers make it impossible to break this scheme. A Bitcoin address is more secure than Fort Knox.</p><p>5)&nbsp;<strong>Permissionless</strong>: You don‘t have to ask anybody to use cryptocurrency. It‘s just a software that everybody can download for free. After you installed it, you can receive and send Bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies. No one can prevent you. There is no gatekeeper.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(145,144,NULL,NULL,'<p>1) <strong>Controlled supply</strong>: Most cryptocurrencies limit the supply of the tokens. In Bitcoin, the supply decreases in time and will reach its final number sometime around the year 2140. All cryptocurrencies control the supply of the token by a schedule written in the code. This means the monetary supply of a cryptocurrency in every given moment in the future can roughly be calculated today. There is no surprise.</p><p>2)&nbsp;<strong>No debt but bearer</strong>:&nbsp;The Fiat-money on your bank account is created by debt, and the numbers, you see on your ledger represent nothing but debts. It‘s a system of IOU. Cryptocurrencies don‘t represent debts, they just represent themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>To understand the revolutionary impact of cryptocurrencies you need to consider both properties. Bitcoin as a permissionless, irreversible, and pseudonymous means of payment is an attack on the control of banks and governments over the monetary transactions of their citizens. You can‘t hinder someone to use Bitcoin, you can‘t prohibit someone to accept a payment, you can‘t undo a transaction.</p><p>As money with a limited, controlled supply that is not changeable by a government, a bank or any other central institution, cryptocurrencies attack the scope of the monetary policy. They take away the control central banks take on inflation or deflation by manipulating the monetary supply.</p><hr class=\\\"wp-block-separator\\\"/><p><strong>“While it’s still fairly new and unstable relative to the gold standard, cryptocurrency is definitely gaining traction and will most certainly have more normalized uses in the next few years. Right now, in particular, it’s increasing in popularity with the post-election market uncertainty. The key will be in making it easy for large-scale adoption (as with anything involving crypto) including developing safeguards and protections for buyers/investors. I expect that&nbsp;within two years, we’ll be in a place where people can shove their money under the virtual mattress through cryptocurrency, and they’ll know that wherever they go, that money will be there.” – Sarah Granger, Author, and Speaker.&nbsp;</strong></p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(146,145,NULL,NULL,'<p>Mostly due to its revolutionary properties cryptocurrencies have become a success their inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto, didn‘t dare to dream of it.

Sometimes it feels more like religion than technology.</p><p>Cryptocurrencies are digital gold. Sound money that is secure from political influence. Money promises to preserve and increase its value over time. Cryptocurrencies are also a fast and comfortable means of payment with a worldwide scope, and they are private and anonymous enough to serve as a means of payment for black markets and any other outlawed economic activity.</p><p>But while cryptocurrencies are more used for payment, its use as a means of speculation and a store of value dwarfs the payment aspects.

Bitcoin serves as a digital gold standard in the whole cryptocurrency-industry, is used as a global means of payment and is the de-facto currency of cyber-crime like darknet markets or ransomware. After seven years in existence, Bitcoin‘s price has increased from zero to more than 650 Dollar, and its transaction volume reached more than 200.000 daily transactions.</p><p>There is not much more to say – Bitcoin is here to stay.</p><h2><strong>Ethereum</strong></h2><p>The brainchild of young crypto-genius Vitalik Buterin has ascended to the second place in the hierarchy of cryptocurrencies. Other than Bitcoin its blockchain does not only validate a set of accounts and balances but of so-called states. This means that ethereum can not only process transactions but complex contracts and programs.</p><p>This flexibility makes Ethereum the perfect instrument for blockchain -application. But it comes at a cost. After the Hack of the DAO – an Ethereum based smart contract – the developers decided to do a hard fork without consensus, which resulted in the emerge of Ethereum Classic. Besides this, there are several clones of Ethereum, and Ethereum itself is a host of several Tokens like DigixDAO and Augur. This makes ethereum more a family of cryptocurrencies than a single currency.</p><h2><strong>Ripple</strong></h2><p>While Ripple has a native cryptocurrency – XRP – it is more about a network to process IOUs than the cryptocurrency itself. XRP, the currency, doesn‘t serve as a medium to store and exchange value, but more as a token to protect the network against spam.</p><p>Ripple, unlike Bitcoin and ethereum, has no mining since all the coins are already pre-mined. Ripple has found immense value in the financial space as a lot of banks have joined the Ripple network.</p><h2><strong>Litecoin</strong></h2><p>Litecoin was one of the first cryptocurrencies after Bitcoin and tagged as the silver to the digital gold bitcoin. Faster than bitcoin, with a larger amount of token and a new mining algorithm, Litecoin was a real innovation, perfectly tailored to be the smaller brother of bitcoin. “It facilitated the emerge of several other cryptocurrencies which used its codebase but made it, even more, lighter“. Examples are Dogecoin or Feathercoin.</p><p>While Litecoin failed to find a real use case and lost its second place after bitcoin, it is still actively developed and traded and is hoarded as a backup if Bitcoin fails.</p><h2><strong>Monero</strong></h2><p>Monero is the most prominent example of the CryptoNight algorithm. This algorithm was invented to add the privacy features Bitcoin is missing. If you use Bitcoin, every transaction is documented in the blockchain and the trail of transactions can be followed. With the introduction of a concept called ring-signatures, the CryptoNight algorithm was able to cut through that trail.</p><p>The first implementation of CryptoNight, Bytecoin, was heavily premined and thus rejected by the community. Monero was the first non-premined clone of bytecoin and raised a lot of awareness. There are several other incarnations of cryptonote with their own little improvements, but none of it did ever achieve the same popularity as Monero.</p><p>Monero‘s popularity peaked in summer 2016 when some darknet markets decided to accept it as a currency. This resulted in a steady increase in the price, while the actual usage of Monero seems to remain disappointingly small.</p><p>Besides those, there are hundreds of cryptocurrencies of several families. Most of them are nothing more than attempts to reach investors and quickly make money, but a lot of them promise playgrounds to test innovations in cryptocurrency-technology.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(148,147,NULL,NULL,'<p>Your standard cryptocurrency has evolved significantly over time. One of the most significant crypto implementations happens to be stablecoins, aka cryptocurrencies that use special cryptography to remain price stable. There are three kinds of stablecoins in the market:</p><ul><li>Fiat-backed.</li><li>Crypto-backed.</li><li>Algorithm-based (seignorage).</li></ul><p>If you wish to learn more about stablecoins then do check out our guide on the same. While there is no need to get into the details, let’s see why these have exploded in popularity in recent times.</p><ul><li><strong>The best of both worlds:</strong>&nbsp;One of the most attractive features of stablecoins is the fact that it provides you with the best of both worlds, fiat, and crypto. The lack of stability and extreme volatility have been often cited as the biggest reasons holding back crypto adoption. However, stablecoins completely mitigate this issue by ensuring price stability. However, despite this, it’s still based on blockchain technology and gives you the benefits of decentralization and immutability inherent in blockchain technology.</li><li><strong>DApps:</strong>&nbsp;Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has been touted as the future of finance and one of the biggest drivers of blockchain adoption. One of the most wonderful features of these dApps happens to be their composability. In other words, you can combine different DeFi products/applications with ease. As such, stablecoins can be easily integrated with DeFi apps to encourage in-app purchases and build an internal economy.</li><li><strong>Faster remittance:</strong>&nbsp;Stablecoins allow you to conduct cross-border payments and remittances at a much faster rate.</li></ul>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(149,148,NULL,NULL,'<p>Central Bank Digital Currencies or CBDCs are a practical implementation of stablecoins that can push cryptocurrency into the mainstream market. The idea is to have a digital form of fiat money that can be used as legal tender, generated by the country’s central bank.</p><h3>What are the advantages of CBDC?</h3><ul><li>The cost of making cash can be very high for countries living on secluded islands. CBDCs can help mitigate these costs.</li><li>Traditional financial systems often deal with loads of intermediaries involved that shoot up the costs and fees involved.</li><li>CBDC could be a brilliant method for banking the unbanked. According to the World Bank, around 80% of people in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam, and 30% in Malaysia and Thailand, are unbanked. In Myanmar, only 23% of people have a legit bank account. CBDC can help create an inclusive financial system.</li><li>CBDC can make the global payment system a lot more resilient. Currently, the payment system is concentrated in the hands of a few large companies. Using a DLT-based coin can have a very positive effect here.</li><li>According to IMF, a properly executed CBDC can counter new digital currencies. Privately-issued digital currencies can be a regulatory nightmare. A domestically-issued CBDC which is, denominated in the domestic unit of account, would help counter this problem.</li><li>One of the biggest problems with cryptocurrencies is its price volatility. With CBDCs, governments can use a private blockchain to control price volatility. While this will compromise on decentralization, it can help increase the widespread usage of blockchain technology.</li><li>Speaking of widespread usage of blockchain technology, utilizing CBDCs can help banks experiment more with Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Some central banks are considering the option of providing CBDC only to institutional market participants in order to develop DLT-based asset markets.</li><li>CBDCs can increase the economy’s response to changes in the policy rate. For example, during a period of prolonged crisis, CBDCs can theoretically be used to charge negative interest rates.</li><li>CBDCs can help encourage competition and innovation in the financial sector. New entrants can build on the tech to enter the payments space and provide their own solutions. It will also reduce the need for most smaller banks and non-banks to run their payments through the larger banks.</li><li>As electronic and digital payments take over from physical cash, the central banks will look to replace physical cash with its electronic equivalent, i.e., CBDC. Doing this will increase the proceeds from creating money, aka, seigniorage, earned by the bank.</li></ul><h3>Examples of CBDC</h3><ul><li>China and Digital Yuan.</li><li>Bank of Thailand’s and Project Inthanon.</li><li>The Marshall Islands and Marshallese sovereign (SOV).</li></ul>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(150,149,NULL,NULL,'<p>The market of cryptocurrencies is fast and wild.

If you want to use Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency, you will need to have a digital wallet.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(156,155,NULL,NULL,'<p>Millions of people use cryptocurrency wallets, but there is a considerable misunderstanding about how they work. Unlike traditional ‘pocket’ wallets, digital wallets don’t store currency. In fact, currencies don’t get stored in any single location or exist anywhere in any physical form. All that exists are records of transactions stored on the blockchain.</p><p>Cryptocurrency wallets are software programs that store your public and private keys and interface with various blockchains so users can monitor their balance, send money, and conduct other operations. When a person sends you bitcoins or any other type of digital currency, they are essentially signing off ownership of the coins to your wallet’s address. To be able to spend those coins and unlock the funds, the private key stored in your wallet must match the public address the currency is assigned to. If the public and private keys match, the balance in your digital wallet will increase, and the senders will decrease accordingly. There is no actual exchange of real coins. The transaction is signified merely by a transaction record on the blockchain and a change in balance in your cryptocurrency wallet.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(157,156,NULL,NULL,'<p>There are several types of wallets that provide different ways to store and access your digital currency. Wallets can be broken down into three distinct categories – software, hardware, and paper. Software wallets can be desktop, mobile, or online.</p><ul><li><strong>Desktop:</strong> wallets are downloaded and installed on a PC or laptop. They are only accessible from the single computer in which they are downloaded. Desktop wallets offer one of the highest levels of security however if your computer is hacked or gets a virus there is the possibility that you may lose all your funds.</li><li><strong>Online: </strong>wallets run on the cloud and are accessible from any computing device in any location. While they are more convenient to access, online wallets store your private keys online and are controlled by a third party which makes them more vulnerable to hacking attacks and theft.</li><li><strong>Mobile: </strong>wallets run on an app on your phone and are useful because they can be used anywhere including retail stores. Mobile wallets are usually much smaller and simpler than desktop wallets because of the limited space available on mobile.</li><li><strong>Hardware: </strong>wallets differ from software wallets in that they store a user’s private keys on a hardware device like a USB. Although hardware wallets make transactions online, they are stored offline which delivers increased security. Hardware wallets can be compatible with several web interfaces and can support different currencies; it just depends on which one you decide to use. What’s more, making a transaction is easy. Users simply plug in their device to any internet-enabled computer or device, enter a pin, send currency and confirm. Hardware wallets make it possible to easily transact while also keeping your money offline and away from danger.</li><li><strong>Paper:</strong> wallets are easy to use and provide a very high level of security. While the term paper wallet can simply refer to a physical copy or printout of your public and private keys, it can also refer to a piece of software that is used to securely generate a pair of keys which are then printed. Using a paper wallet is relatively straightforward. Transferring Bitcoin or any other currency to your paper wallet is accomplished by the transfer of funds from your software wallet to the public address shown on your paper wallet. Alternatively, if you want to withdraw or spend currency, all you need to do is transfer funds from your paper wallet to your software wallet. This process, often referred to as ‘sweeping,’ can either be done manually by entering your private keys or by scanning the QR code on the paper wallet.</li></ul>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(158,157,NULL,NULL,'<p>Wallets are secure to varying degrees. The level of security depends on the type of wallet you use (desktop, mobile, online, paper, hardware) and the service provider. A web server is an intrinsically riskier environment to keep your currency compared to offline. Online wallets can expose users to possible vulnerabilities in the wallet platform which can be exploited by hackers to steal your funds. Offline wallets, on the other hand, cannot be hacked because they simply aren’t connected to an online network and don’t rely on a third party for security.</p><p>Although online wallets have proven the most vulnerable and prone to hacking attacks, diligent security precautions need to be implemented and followed when using any wallet. Remember that no matter which wallet you use, losing your private keys will lead you to lose your money. Similarly, if your wallet gets hacked, or you send money to a scammer, there is no way to reclaim lost currency or reverse the transaction. You must take precautions and be very careful!</p><ul><li><strong>Backup your wallet.</strong> Store only small amounts of currency for everyday use online, on your computer or mobile, keeping the vast majority of your funds in a high-security environment. Cold or offline storage options for backup like Ledger Nano X or paper or USB will protect you against computer failures and allow you to recover your wallet should it be lost or stolen. It will not, however, protect you against eager hackers. The reality is, if you choose to use an online wallet there are inherent risks that can’t always be protected against.</li><li><strong>Update software</strong>. Keep your software up to date so that you have the latest security enhancements available. You should regularly update not only your wallet software but also the software on your computer or mobile.</li><li><strong>Add extra security layers.</strong> The more layers of security, the better. Setting long and complex passwords and ensuring any withdrawal of funds requires a password is a start. Use wallets that have a good reputation and provide extra security layers like two-factor authentication and additional pin code requirements every time a wallet application gets opened. You may also want to consider a wallet that offers multisig transactions like Armory or Copay. A multisig or multi-signature wallet requires the permission of another user or users before a transaction can be made.</li></ul>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(159,158,NULL,NULL,'<p>Although Bitcoin is by far the most well-known and popular digital currency, hundreds of new cryptocurrencies (referred to as altcoins) have emerged, each with distinctive ecosystems and infrastructure. If you’re interested in using a variety of cryptocurrencies, the good news is, you don’t need to set up a separate wallet for each currency. Instead of using a cryptocurrency wallet that supports a single currency, it may be more convenient to set up a multi-currency wallet which enables you to use several currencies from the same wallet.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(160,159,NULL,NULL,'<p>There is no straightforward answer here.</p><p>In general, transaction fees are a tiny fraction of traditional bank fees. Sometimes fees need to be paid for certain types of transactions to network miners as a processing fee, while some transactions don’t have any fee at all. It’s also possible to set your own fee. As a guide, the median transaction size of 226 bytes would result in a fee of 18,080 satoshis or $0.12. In some cases, if you choose to set a low fee, your transaction may get low priority, and you might have to wait hours or even days for the transaction to get confirmed. If you need your transaction completed and confirmed promptly, then you might need to increase the amount you’re willing to pay.

If that’s the case, then you should make your peace with not liquidating your crypto assets.So, the important takeaway here is to only risk as much money as you can afford. Like Wence Casares, CEO of Xapo sums it up in an AMA on bitcoin.com:</p><blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p><strong>“I always tell them [my family] that the second most stupid thing they could do right now is to own a number of bitcoins they cannot afford to lose and the most stupid thing they could do would be to not own any. “</strong></p></blockquote><p><strong>Remember That There are Other Coins</strong></p><p>Up until late 2016 Bitcoin was the cryptocurrency, and there was not much besides it. If you wanted to invest in the success of cryptocurrencies, you bought Bitcoin. Period. Other cryptocurrencies – called “Altcoins” – have just been penny stocks on shady online-markets, mostly used to keep miner’s GPUs working, pump the price and dump the coins.</p><p>However, this has changed. While Bitcoin is still the dominant cryptocurrency, in 2017 it’s a share of the whole crypto-market rapidly fell from 90 to around 40 percent, and it sits around 50% as of September 2018.</p><p>There are several reasons for that. While Bitcoin remains the undisputed king of cryptocurrencies, many people have questioned its future utility. Firstly, there were new and exciting cryptocurrencies coming out secondly, Bitcoin was suffering from severe performance issues and it looked like the Bitcoin community were nowhere near to solving this problem. The block-size issue, in particular, was a huge bone of contention in the community, which ultimately led to the creation of bitcoin cash and the splitting up of the community.</p><p>So, the question is, what coins can you potentially invest in?</p><p>Well, for that you will go to&nbsp;<strong>coinmarketcap.com</strong>.</p><figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large\\\"><img loading=\\\"lazy\\\" width=\\\"1024\\\" height=\\\"586\\\" src=\\\"https://bc.foobrdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/word-image-2-1024x586.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-3288\\\" title=\\\"How To Invest in Cryptocurrencies The Ultimate Beginners Guide\\\" srcset=\\\"https://bc.foobrdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/word-image-2-1024x586.png 1024w, https://bc.foobrdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/word-image-2-300x172.png 300w, https://bc.foobrdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/word-image-2-768x439.png 768w, https://bc.foobrdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/word-image-2.png 1119w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\\\" /></figure><p>This website lists down cryptocurrencies in decreasing order of marketcap. Market cap means the value of all token available. It is not a perfect metric, but likely the best we have to recognize the value of a cryptocurrency.</p><p>This is the reason why the <strong>coinmarketcap</strong> is a useful tool to have in your hand.</p><p><strong>Think About the Utility That the Coin Is Bringing Into The System</strong></p><p>So, you have gone through the market caps and decided on the bunch of coins that you wanted to invest in? Awesome job. However, this is where the real work begins.</p><p>The first thing that you need to do is to read their whitepapers. Now, we understand that reading PDFs may not be the most exciting of things, however, you absolutely have to put in the work beforehand before you reap any sort of benefits.</p><p>Reading the whitepaper itself will give you two tremendous benefits:</p><ul><li>Firstly, you will be more knowledgeable about the coin itself and learn about the utility that it is bringing into the ecosystem.</li><li>Secondly, a poorly written whitepaper is often a good sign of knowing whether a project is worth investing in or not. If the team itself can’t simply explain the true utility of their token, then it is probably not worth investing into.</li></ul><p>A white paper is the bread and butter of any and all ICOs. According to Wikipedia.</p><blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p><strong>“A white paper is an authoritative report or guide that informs readers concisely about a complex issue and presents the issuing body’s philosophy on the matter. It is meant to help readers understand an issue, solve a problem, or make a decision.”</strong></p></blockquote><p>In simpler terms, a white paper can tell potential investors everything they need to know about the project. This is the reason why an ICO which doesn’t have a whitepaper should simply be looked over.</p><p>Another thing that most ICOs realize is that the majority of investors simply won’t bother to read through the whitepaper. This is the reason why they simply outsource their whitepapers to cheap freelance writers who end up creating proper works of art. “Art” is being used extremely liberally here of course. Check out this gem of a whitepaper by “Arbitrage Crypto Trader”.</p><p>Here is an extract from the whitepaper:</p><blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p><strong>“However, the arbitration did not die definitively. He again in favor, thanks to the appearance of cryptocurrency. All of us see that right now quotations bitkoyna on different stock exchanges differ from each other by 1-5%. And for some of the Altocums, the difference can sometimes be as high as 50%.”</strong></p></blockquote><p>It’s ok, don’t bother making sense of it.</p><p>A well-crafted whitepaper can define a generation. Just look at what Bitcoin’s whitepaper has done to this era. An ICO which doesn’t bother putting in any effort shouldn’t be given any attention.</p><p>Having said that, after you read a decently written whitepaper, there are some decisions that you will need to make.</p><p><strong>Check #1: The Value that The Project is Bringing in</strong></p><p>Firstly, check the project to see whether the coin is bringing in any real utility into the ecosystem. The perfect example of this is Ethereum. There is a reason why it took of so fast, think of the sheer value that it was bringing in. For the first time, developers around the world had a platform that they could use to build their own dapps on a blockchain.</p><p>Along with that, keep in mind the issues that crypto world is desperately looking to solve, mainly: privacy, scalability, and interoperability. A good way to go about your investment is to find the projects which are specifically working on solving the aforementioned problems. Here are some of the projects that are looking to solve each of the three aforementioned problems:</p><ul><li>Privacy: Monero, Zcash, Dash</li><li>Scalability: OmiseGo, Cardano</li><li>Interoperability: AION</li></ul><p><strong>Check #2: Does the Project Need Tokens?</strong></p><p>So, how do you make sure that you are getting good quality tokens?</p><p>You inspect the project and ask yourself the following questions:</p><ul><li>Does this project need to be on the blockchain?</li><li>Does this project need to have tokens?</li></ul><p>If the answer for any of those happens to be “No”, then those projects don’t need a token and those projects are doing an ICO simply to raise money. There is a way to find out the true utility of the token.</p><p>For this, we will take the help of William Mougayar who points out in his Medium article that there are three tenets to token utility:</p><ul><li>Role.</li><li>Features.</li><li>Purpose.</li></ul><p>These three are locked up in a triangle and they look like this:</p><figure class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\"><img src=\\\"https://courses.blockgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/word-image-3.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-113855\\\" title=\\\"How To Invest in Cryptocurrencies \\\"/></figure><p>Each token role has its own set of features and purpose which are detailed in the following table:</p><figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large\\\"><img loading=\\\"lazy\\\" width=\\\"800\\\" height=\\\"610\\\" src=\\\"https://bc.foobrdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/word-image-4.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-3287\\\" srcset=\\\"https://bc.foobrdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/word-image-4.png 800w, https://bc.foobrdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/word-image-4-300x229.png 300w, https://bc.foobrdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/word-image-4-768x586.png 768w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\" /></figure>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(169,168,NULL,NULL,'<p><strong>Right</strong></p><p>By taking possession of a particular token, the holder gets a certain amount of rights within the ecosystem. Eg. by having DAO coins in your possession, you could have had voting rights inside the DAO to decide which projects get funding and which don’t.</p><p><strong>Value Exchange</strong></p><p>The tokens create an internal economic system within the confines of the project itself. The tokens can help the buyers and sellers trade value within the ecosystem. This helps people gain rewards upon completion of particular tasks. This creation and maintenance of individual, internal economies are one of the most important tasks of Tokens.</p><p><strong>Toll</strong></p><p>It can also act as a toll gateway in order for you to use certain functionalities of a particular system. Eg. in Golem, you need to have GNT (golem tokens) to gain access to the benefits of the Golem supercomputer.</p><p><strong>Function</strong></p><p>The token can also enable the holders to enrich the user experience inside the confines of the particular environment. Eg. In Brave (a web browser), holders of BAT (tokens used in Brave) will get the right to enrich the customer experience by using their tokens to add advertisements or other attention-based services on the Brave platform.</p><p><strong>Currency</strong></p><p>It can be used as a store of value that can be used to conduct transactions both inside and outside the given ecosystem.</p><p><strong>Earnings</strong></p><p>Helps in an equitable distribution of profits or other related financial benefits among investors in a particular project.</p><p>So, how does this all help in token utility?</p><p>If you want to maximize the amount of utility that your token can provide then you need to tick off more than one of these properties. The more properties you can tick off, the more utility and value your token brings into your ecosystem. If the role of your tokens cannot be clearly explained, or if it doesn’t really tick off more than one of the roles given above, then your token doesn’t have any utility and you can do without it.</p><p>Now, why shouldn’t you take useless tokens with little to no utility?</p><p>For that, we need to understand the concept of token velocity. Token velocity is an indication of how much people respect the value of that particular token. If people hold on to a token, then it has low velocity. However, if people quickly sell that token for BTC, ETH, or Fiat then that token has high velocity.</p><p>If you were to define Token Velocity in strictly mathematical terms, then it would look like this:</p><p>Token Velocity = Total Transactional Volume / Average Network Value.</p><p>If we were to flip the formula then:</p><p>Average Network Value = Total Transactional Volume / Token Velocity.</p><p>Now, that leads to two conclusions:</p><ul><li>More the token velocity, the less the average network value.</li><li>More the transactional volume, the more the token velocity.</li></ul><p>This is the reason why you should work for a project whose tokens actually have some utility and gives their users a reason to hold on to them.</p><p>Alright, so now that you know what kinds of coins you should invest in, we will now teach you how to look for obvious signs of scams.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(170,169,NULL,NULL,'<p>Good coins have a transparent technical vision, an active development team, and a vivid, enthusiastic community. Bad coins are transparent, promote fuzzy technical advantages without explaining how to reach them, and have a community that is mostly focused on getting rich quick.

However, what are some of the more obvious signs of scams?</p><p><strong>#1 The Team</strong></p><p>It really goes without saying that the success of a project is directly related to the credibility of the team.

Not only do they have an incredible team, but they also count people like Vitalik Buterin and Lightning Network Creator Joseph Poon among their advisors as well.

In cases like that, you should adopt a more hands-on approach.</p><p>First, search for the names of the team members on Google. Most of the time they should have a LinkedIn profile. Do a quick search and learn more about the team members. Ask yourself the following questions:</p><ul><li>Have they been involved in any successful ICO venture before?</li><li>Have they been involved in a well-reputed company (Google, Deloitte, etc.)?</li><li>Have they been recommended or endorsed by well-known people?</li></ul><p>It doesn’t matter if you come across as stalkerish. You must put in this work so that you don’t end up wasting your time and resources later.</p><p>Secondly, you should search for the images of the team members on Google.

As Bitcoin rises, more and more brokers and exchanges try to set up a Bitcoin-based financial product.</p><p>All these investment products have in common that they enable investors to bet on Bitcoin’s price without actually buying Bitcoin.

Coinbase is a perfect example of this kind of exchange. Coinbase helps you buy BTC, BCH, LTC, and ETH in exchange for Fiat currency.</p><p><strong>Crypto to Crypto</strong></p><p>Then we have the Crypto to Crypto exchanges. These exchanges help you exchange certain cryptos like BTC, ETH, BCH etc. for other cryptocurrencies. Binance is a fine example of a crypto-to-crypto exchange.</p><p>While they do offer pretty valuable services, the problem is that they are all centralized, which makes them vulnerable.

On some exchanges, like Bitcoin.de, you don’t need to fund your account, but trade directly with other users.</li></ul><p>The question, what exchange to use depends mostly on where you live. It’s always better to use an exchange physically close to you. If it is located in the same jurisdiction as you, you have the best chances to get money legally back if some bad things happen. If no exchange is located in your jurisdiction, it is better to use exchanges based in stable countries with a good legal system.</p><p>Another factor to decide which exchange you use is some coins you want to buy and your patience. If you want to acquire large sums of Bitcoins fastly, you need to use one of the major exchanges which provide enough liquidity. If you only want to buy small amounts of coins and if you are not in a hurry, you can try to buy them on small exchanges.

The best time might be when the price is stable at a relatively low level.</p><p>The art of trading is to decide when a crypto is in bubble mode and when it reached the bottom after falling. What is easy to say in retrospective is a hard question in the present, which can never be answered with absolute certainty. Sometimes a coin starts to raise, and after it passes a mark, where everybody thinks this must be the peak of a bubble, the real rally just begins.</p><p>For example, many people did not buy Bitcoin at $1,000 or Ether at $100, because it seemed to be crazily expensive. But some months later these prices appear to have been a good moment to start.</p><p>There is only two pieces of advice about timing we can give. First, don’t compare crypto bubbles with traditional financial bubbles. 10 percent up is not a bubble but can be daily volatility. 100 percent up can be a bubble, but often it is just the start of it. 1,000 percent might be a bubble usually, but there is no guarantee that it pops.</p><p>Second, take some time to watch. Don’t buy-in, because there was a dip. There might be another. And don’t buy-in, because you fear that it will explode tomorrow.

Hot storage is like the wallets that you carry around in your pocket. The Cold storage is basically somewhat akin to your savings bank account. Keep this distinction in mind as we move forward. Basically, if you want to use your currency frequently then you must use hot storage. On the other hand, if you want to store your money for a long time then you must use cold storage.</p><h3>Hot Wallet/Storage</h3><p>Hot storage, in simple terms, is when you keep your cryptocurrency in a device that is directly connected to the internet. This connection is what makes a device “hot”.</p><p>You should think of exchange wallets, desktop clients, and mobile wallets (any wallet that exists on a device that will ever connect to the internet) as a hot wallet. It’s easy to access funds on a hot wallet, and if you live somewhere that accepts cryptos for micropayments, there’s nothing wrong with using one for day-to-day spending. Think of it like fiat (government-issued) currency. You might walk around with a portion of your wealth in a wallet for convenience but the majority you keep secured away. Your hot wallet should behave in the same way as a real-world wallet. You use it to carry a small amount of cash for ease of access. That is all.</p><p>While transacting with hot wallets is very simple, there is a huge drawback when it comes to them. They are easily hackable. The whole crypto-space has been gaining a lot of value recently and where there’s value, crime is never far behind. Recent ransomware attacks and previous compromises of large exchanges should be sufficient beacons to newcomers.</p><p>Even though you’ll not be storing a great deal of value on your hot wallet, it’s vital that you follow the backup steps within the restoration section of your wallet to avoid losing funds through human error.

For those seeking the most secure form of storage, cold wallets are the way to go. These are best suited to long term holders, who don’t require access to their coins for months, or years at a time.</p><p>They aren’t without their own set of risks but if you follow the instructions correctly, and take every precaution possible, these are greatly minimized. Given the amount of attention that cryptocurrency has been receiving over the last few years, it has unfortunately piqued the interest of attackers. In light of that, it’s a far more secure option to use cold storage as a means of storing your money.</p><p>San Francisco based bitcoin wallet and exchange service CoinBase holds up 97% of its coin reserves in hardware and paper wallets. What are hardware and paper wallets? You will get to know about it in a minute. For now, let’s check out the pros and cons of cold storage:</p><p><strong>Pros of Cold Storage:</strong></p><ul><li>A great place to hold large amounts of coin for a long period of time.</li><li>It provides a safety net against hackers and people with malicious intent since it is completely offline.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons of Cold Storage</strong></p><ul><li>It is still susceptible to external damage, theft and general human carelessness.</li><li>It is not ideal for quick and daily transactions.</li><li>Setting it up can be a little intimidating for beginners.</li></ul><p>Now that we have seen both the pros and cons let’s take a look some cold storage wallets that you can use to store your coins</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(176,175,NULL,NULL,'<p>Without a doubt, the safest way to store any cryptocurrency is by using a paper wallet. By following a few pointers below, you can set one up entirely for free. This truly makes you the master of your investment, and if precautions are followed, there’s no possibility of your private keys being known by anyone else. Of course, this means that keeping a record of them is even more important. Losing private keys means you’ll forfeit the entire contents of your paper wallet (but then again, that’s true for every wallet out there.)</p><h3>What is a paper wallet?</h3><p>To keep it very simple, paper wallets are an offline cold storage method of saving cryptocurrency. It includes printing out your public and private keys in a piece of paper which you then store and save in a secure place. The keys are printed in the form of QR codes which you can scan in the future for all your transactions. The reason why it is so safe is that it gives complete control to you, the user. You do not need to worry about the well-being of a piece of hardware, nor do you have to worry about hackers or any piece of malware. You just need to take care of a piece of paper.</p><h3>Do you need a paper wallet?</h3><p>The answer to this question will largely depend on your circumstances. If you plan to spend the summer day trading a few coins, perhaps you don’t. Alternatively, if you’re in for the long haul, and don’t intend to touch any portion of your stash, then a paper wallet is the most secure option available to you.

If you have issues with taxes, and if large sums are at stake, you better ask your local tax consultant.</p><p>Right now there are only a few tax consultants who know how to deal with cryptocurrencies. But it can be safely assumed that the number is growing quickly and that cryptocurrencies will soon be a standard issue for tax experts like securities, shares, ETFs and real estates are.</p><p>All we can provide here is an overview of the typical issues with cryptocurrencies and taxes.</p><p><strong>No Free Lunch</strong></p><p>Nothing is for sure, except death and taxes. The same goes on with cryptocurrencies. If you earn money by investing in cryptocurrencies, you likely have to pay taxes. Like it is with everything else.</p><p>How you need to tax cryptocurrency investment returns is up to your national tax jurisdiction.</p><p><strong>The Good News …</strong></p><p>There is some good news about the topic of cryptocurrencies and taxes. First, in nearly every country of the world cryptocurrencies are VAT exempt. Like with every financial product you don’t need to pay VAT when selling Bitcoin. There have been some ideas of tax authorities in Poland, Estonia, Germany, Australia, and Sweden to demand VAT on crypto sales, but after the European Court smashed this down in an important decision, VAT for Bitcoins seems to have become a non-topic.</p><p>Another good news is that in some jurisdictions you have to pay nearly no taxes. Amazingly Germany, a country usually known for very high tax rates, has become a tax haven for cryptocurrencies. Like the USA and many other countries, Germany considers Bitcoin not a financial product, but a property. This means that if you earn money by trading it, you don’t pay a flat tax for financial income – which is 25 percent, for example for bank account interest – but you have to tax the profit of buying and selling cryptocurrencies like income.</p><p>t’s more as you sold your house than a security.</p><p>You bought 10 Bitcoins for 1,000 Euro and sold them for 2,000? Your taxable income increased by 10,000 Euro.</p><p>You bought one bitcoin for 100 Euro and ordered a 10-Euro-pizza when the price was 1,000 Euro? Your income increased by 9 Euro. In most cases, the tax rate for this is higher than for financial gains.</p><p>However, there is a loophole. If you hold your coins for more than 1 year, you don’t need to pay taxes at all when you sell it. This rule was added to dis-incentivize day trading of other properties and stabilize prices by incentivizing holders. For cryptocurrencies it made Germany, and also the Netherlands, which apply the same rules, to tax havens. Some countries might have similar rules. In doubt, your tax advisor can help you out.</p><p>One problem the one year rule poses is that you need to prove that you hold the crypto for this timeframe. Usually, exchanges can help you with prints of your trade history. Also, you can use the public blockchain as proof of storage. In most cryptocurrencies, it is transparent when coins are received and spent by a particular address. But not in all. For example, Monero uses Ring Signatures and Confidential Transactions, which are great tools to maintain anonymity. But the downside is that they make it more or less impossible to prove that you hold coins for more than one year. Maybe you take this into account when selecting coins for your portfolio.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(178,177,NULL,NULL,'<p><strong>Bad News …</strong></p><p>If you use a good exchange and keep track of your trades, taxing Bitcoin is possible, but also a pain in the ass. You need to calculate every single profit, not just from trading, but also from using Bitcoins to pay for things.</p><p>But that’s just the beginning. Things become really a complicated nightmare if it comes to Altcoins. For the tax authorities, an Altcoin counts like Bitcoin. In most countries, this means it is not a financial product, but a property. If you buy it with Bitcoin and sell it for Bitcoin, you have to tax the difference, but not in Bitcoin, but in Dollar or your national paper money. This means, you not only need to keep track of all your Altcoin trades, but you also need to take into account the price of Bitcoin when buying and selling.</p><p>Obviously, this makes things extremely complicated. You can have a bad trade, resulting in getting less Bitcoin back than you invested, but being still, in theory, accountable to taxes, when the price of Bitcoin did soar between your trades. So you lost money in trading but have to pay taxes for it.</p><p>At this moment you should accept the fact that cryptocurrencies are something new and that you are no expert in dealing with your financial authorities. Go for a tax consultant, educate her or him about cryptocurrencies and look forward to talking with confused financial authority officials.</p><p>And enjoy investing in cryptocurrencies.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(179,178,NULL,NULL,'<p>In a nutshell, a cryptocurrency broker is an online brokerage platform that allows you to buy and sell popular digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple. The process operates much the same as a traditional stockbroker, insofar that you will need to open an account, deposit funds, and decide which asset you wish to invest in. You will then need to determine how much you want to invest, and the broker will facilitate the purchase on your behalf.</p><p>With that being said, there are two types of cryptocurrency brokers active in the online space, and the one that you opt for will depend on your personal requirements. This consists of a cryptocurrency broker that allows you to purchase digital currencies in their truest form, meaning that you will need to then store your coins in a private wallet.</p><p>Alternatively, some traders prefer to use cryptocurrency brokers that facilitate CFD products. This allows you to invest in cryptocurrencies without owning the underlying asset, meaning that you do not need to worry about storage. Moreover, CFD brokers allow you to short cryptocurrencies, so you can speculate that the value of the asset will go down.</p><p>In a similar nature to traditional brokers, you will need to pay a fee to invest in cryptocurrencies. This usually comes in the form of a commission, which is calculated against the value of your investment. You need to pay this at both ends of your trade. If using a CFD cryptocurrency broker, then you will likely be able to trade on a commission-free basis. You will, however, need to pay a fee in the form of the spread.</p><h2>Pros and Cons of Cryptocurrency Brokers</h2><h2>The Pros</h2><ul><li>Gives you access to the multi-billion pound cryptocurrency scene</li><li>Heaps of everyday payment methods supported</li><li>Ability to short cryptocurrencies via CFDs</li><li>Cryptocurrency brokers operate on a 24/7 basis</li><li>Leading platforms allow you to verify your identity in minutes</li><li>Investment fees are becoming more and more competitive</li><li>Some cryptocurrency brokers are regulated by the FCA</li></ul><h2>The Cons</h2><ul><li>Cryptocurrencies are a high-risk asset class</li><li>A number of brokers have been hacked in recent years</li><li>Some cryptocurrency brokers operate in an unregulated manner</li></ul>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(180,179,NULL,NULL,'<p>There are two types of cryptocurrency brokers active in the UK space – brokers that allow you to own cryptocurrencies 100% outright, and brokers that facilitate cryptocurrency investments via CFDs.</p><p>Below we explain how the two broker-types differ.</p><h3>Own Cryptocurrencies Outright</h3><p>If you’re looking to invest in popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and you wish to own the asset 100% outright, then you will need to use a specialist cryptocurrency broker. The overarching concept is that you will personally take ownership of the coins and thus – you will need to store them in a private wallet.&nbsp; This comes with both its pros and cons.</p><p>On the one hand, by storing the coins in a private wallet, they will always remain in your possession no matter what. As such, you are not susceptible to a broker collapse. On the other hand, storing the coins yourself does come with its risks. This is because bad actors have the capacity to hack private wallets remotely when the user has failed to install security safeguards.</p><p>Crucially, the safest way to store your coins is to keep them in a hardware wallet, not least because it is never connected to the internet. This does make the process of transferring the coins out somewhat cumbersome, although this is the trade-off that you need to make when owning cryptocurrencies outright.</p><h3>Investing With a Cryptocurrency CFD Broker</h3><p>The second options available to you is to use a cryptocurrency CFD broker. As is the case with other CFD products like stocks, indices, and commodities, you will not own the underlying cryptocurrency asset. Instead, you are merely speculating on which way the markets will go.</p><p>For example, if you like the look of Bitcoin and think that it is due to increase in value over the coming days or weeks, CFDs are a great way to facilitate this. Crucially, CFDs allow you to invest in Bitcoin cheaply and quickly. Moreover, CFDs give you the option of applying leverage, as well as engage in short-selling.</p><p>Regarding the former, this means that you can invest more than you have in your account. And the latter – this is where you speculate on the value of a cryptocurrency going&nbsp;<em>down</em>. A further benefit of using a CFD cryptocurrency broker is that platforms are often regulated by the UK’s FCA or CySEC in Cyprus.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(181,180,NULL,NULL,'<p>In a time not so long ago, buying cryptocurrencies with real-world money was a&nbsp; difficult task, not least because brokers were unable to get the required green light from payment issuers. This meant that you would need to transfer cash to an unregulated broker – many of whom were nothing more than a scam.</p><p>However, with the cryptocurrency industry now a multi-billion pound marketplace, there are heaps of cryptocurrency brokers that support everyday payment methods. This includes the likes of:</p><p>&#x1f947; Visa</p><p>&#x1f947; MasterCard</p><p>&#x1f947; Maestro</p><p>&#x1f947; Paypal</p><p>&#x1f947; Skrill</p><p>&#x1f947; Neteller</p><p>&#x1f947; Local Bank Transfer</p><p>&#x1f947; International Wire</p><p>As we discuss in the next section, cryptocurrencies brokers will sometimes charge you a fee when depositing and withdrawing funds. Furthermore, it’s likely that you will need to meet a minimum deposit amount.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(182,181,NULL,NULL,'<p>Cryptocurrency brokers are in the business of making money, so there is a range of fees that you need to made aware of prior to making an investment. The specific fees will vary from broker-to-broker, so be sure to check this yourself.</p><h3>Deposit and Withdrawal Fees</h3><p>Whether or not you need to pay any deposit and withdrawal fees will depend on two things – the broker and the type of the payment method that you wish to use.</p><p>For example, some of the brokers that we recommend on this page allow you to deposit funds for free, although they typically charge a very small withdrawal method.</p><p>Brokers that do charge a payment fee will usually do this on a percentage basis. For example, if the cryptocurrency broker charges 4% to deposit funds with a debit card, and you wish to deposit £1,000, you will pay a fee of £40.</p><h3>Trading Commissions</h3><p>Some cryptocurrency brokers will charge you a trading commission when you make an investment. If they do, this will be charged at both ends of the trade. Moreover, this is typically calculated as a percentage against the amount you invest.</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li>Let’s say that the cryptocurrency broker charges a 1% trading commission</li><li>You want to buy £500 worth of Bitcoin</li><li>You will be charged a commission of £5 (1% of £500)</li><li>You want to sell your Bitcoin when it is worth £750</li><li>You will be charged a commission of £7.50 (1% of £750)</li></ul><p>As you can see from the above example, you will need to pay a commission when you initially invest in a cryptocurrency, as well as when you decide to sell.</p><h3>Spreads</h3><p>The spread is only relevant if you plan to use a cryptocurrency broker that specializes in CFDs. For those unaware, the spread is the difference between the buy and sell price, so it’s a fee that you pay indirectly.</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li>You use a cryptocurrency CFD broker to invest in Bitcoin</li><li>The ‘buy’ price of Bitcoin is $10,000</li><li>The ‘sell’ price of Bitcoin is $10,100</li><li>The difference between the two prices amounts to 1%</li><li>This means that you need to make at least 1% in gains to break even</li></ul><p>Essentially, you’ll want to use a broker that offers super-tight spreads, as this will help keep your trading costs to a minimum.</p><blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> The vast majority of cryptocurrency CFD brokers allow you to trade on a commission-free basis.

On the flip side,&nbsp; alt-coins have a greater upside potential.

The process works largely the same as making a standard market investment, but in reverse. In other words, you will initially need to place a sell order, and then a buy order when you decide to exit your trade.</p><p>Check out the example below of how a short-sell investment would work at a cryptocurrency broker.</p><ul><li>You’re not a fan of Bitcoin, so you decide to use a CFD broker to short-sell the asset</li><li>Bitcoin is currently priced at £5,000 per coin</li><li>You place a ‘sell’ order at a total stake of £1,000</li><li>A few days later, Bitcoin begins to tank in the markets and it is now worth £4,000 per coin</li><li>This represents a reduction in value of 20%</li><li>You decide to lock-in your profits, so you then place a ‘buy’ order to exit the trade</li><li>You made a total of £200 in profit, based on 20% of your £1,000 stake</li></ul>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(185,184,NULL,NULL,'<p>Do you have a higher tolerance for risk and wish to apply leverage on your cryptocurrency trades? If so, you’re in luck, as there are now dozens of cryptocurrency brokers active in the online space that allow you to apply leverage.

If you are, this means that you will be capped to leverage of 2:1 when trading cryptocurrencies.

Others also hold a license with&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://learn2.trade/best-asic-brokers\\\">ASIC</a>&nbsp;in Australia, meaning you’ll have regulatory oversight on multiple fronts.</p><p>With that being said, we would suggest making the following considerations when choosing a new cryptocurrency broker to ensure your funds remain safe.</p><p>&#x1f947;&nbsp;<strong>Cold Storage</strong>: If you’re using a traditional cryptocurrency broker that allows you to purchase and own digital coins outright, then you should check whether or not the platform utilizes cold storage.

Crucially, this includes logging in and withdrawing funds.</p><p><strong>&#x1f947; Multi-Sig Wallets</strong>: If the cryptocurrency broker utilizes multi-sig wallets, this means that multiple signatures are required for the platform to process withdrawals. Once again, this acts as a major safeguard against third-party hackers</p><p><strong>&#x1f947; Encrypted Data</strong>: If you are planning to deposit funds with a traditional debit or credit card, then you need to ensure that the broker’s website encrypts data.

By following the step-by-step guidelines outlined below, you’ll be able to invest at a cryptocurrency broker within minutes.</p><h2>Step 1: Choose a Cryptocurrency Broker</h2><p>Your first port of call will be to choose a cryptocurrency broker that best meets your needs. You’ll need to consider key factors such as whether you want to buy cryptocurrencies or invest in CFDs, as well as fees, payment methods, customer support, and spreads.</p><p>We would suggest reviewing the section below on&nbsp;<em>how to choose a cryptocurrency broker</em>&nbsp;if you need further assistance. If you don’t have time to research a cryptocurrency broker yourself, why not consider the merits of one of the pre-vetted platforms listed on this page?</p><h2>Step 2: Open an Account</h2><p>Regardless of whether you are using a traditional broker or a CFD platform, you will need to open an account. The amount of information collected from you will depend on the type of cryptocurrency broker that you opt for.</p><p>With that said, if you’re looking to deposit funds with real-world money, then this will likely include the following:</p><ul><li>First and Last Name</li><li>Home Address</li><li>Nationality</li><li>Date of Birth</li><li>Contact Details</li></ul><h2>Step 3: Verify Your Identity</h2><p>You will now need to verify your identity. This is to ensure that the broker remains compliant with its license issuer, as well as domestic laws on anti-money laundering.</p><p>The process requires you to upload a clear copy of your government-issued ID (passport or driver’s license) and a proof of address. This should be a bank statement or utility bill that is dated within the last three months.</p><h2>Step 4: Deposit Funds</h2><p>Once you’ve had your account verified by the cryptocurrency broker, you’ll need to deposit some funds. The specific payment method available to you will depend on the broker, although this usually includes a debit/credit card or bank transfer.</p><p>Some brokers also support e-wallets like Paypal and Skrill. Unless you are using a bank transfer, all other deposit methods are instant.</p><h2>Step 5: Invest in Your Chosen Cryptocurrency</h2><p>You are now ready to make a cryptocurrency investment. You will first need to choose the specific cryptocurrency that you want to buy (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.) and then enter the amount that you wish to invest.</p><figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large\\\"><img loading=\\\"lazy\\\" width=\\\"800\\\" height=\\\"450\\\" src=\\\"https://bc.foobrdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cryptocurrency-1.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-4331\\\" srcset=\\\"https://bc.foobrdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cryptocurrency-1.jpg 800w, https://bc.foobrdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cryptocurrency-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://bc.foobrdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cryptocurrency-1-768x432.jpg 768w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\" /></figure><p>There is no requirement to purchase a whole Bitcoin, so you can buy as little as you like – as long as you meet the broker’s minimum investment amount. The funds will then be debited from your cash balance, and you’ll see the cryptocurrencies added to your account. Note: The process of investing at a CFD cryptocurrency broker remains largely the same, albeit, you won’t need to follow the step below on withdrawing your coins out. This is because the coins do not exist, as you are merely speculating on the asset’s future price.</p><h3>Step 6: Withdraw Coins From the Cryptocurrency Broker</h3><p>You will now need to withdraw your newly purchased cryptocurrency coins out of the broker. Although most platforms allow you to store your coins on the broker’s website, we would strongly advise against this. Crucially, if the broker was hacked by a malicious third-party, you stand the risk of having your coins stolen.</p><p>As such, you should withdraw your coins to a private cryptocurrency wallet. To do this, head over to your wallet and copy your wallet address. Elect to make a withdrawal at the broker by pasting in your wallet address and entering the amount that you wish to cash out. The coins should arrive in your wallet within 1 hour – depending on how long the broker takes to process it.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(188,187,NULL,NULL,'<p>Before signing up with a cryptocurrency broker, we would suggest asking the following five questions.</p><p>&#x2714;&#xfe0f; Is the cryptocurrency broker regulated?</p><p>&#x2714;&#xfe0f; Does the cryptocurrency broker support your preferred payment method?</p><p>&#x2714;&#xfe0f; What deposit, withdrawal, and trading fees does the cryptocurrency broker charge?</p><p>&#x2714;&#xfe0f; Does the broker allow you to purchase Bitcoin outright, or are you investing in CFDs?</p><p>&#x2714;&#xfe0f; Does the cryptocurrency broker list your preferred digital currencies – such as Bitcoin and Ethereum?</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(189,188,NULL,NULL,'<p>A cryptocurrency crowdsale is a method of funding a project through the sale of digital tokens that give their buyer the right to participate in an idea being funded by the sale.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-5\\\">The cryptocurrency crowdsale is designed to turn ideas into reality through the issuance of tokens. Like Bitcoin, a token is not something you can physically hold. Instead, it is an electronic record—a kind of digital poker chip—stored on your computer, or mobile device. Tokens are sold on the Bitcoin blockchain and the Ethereum blockchain, which are public marketplaces accessible to anyone.</p><p>Tokens consist of a cryptographic string of letters and numbers designed to let you participate in the digital project that will eventually be launched as a result of the crowdsale.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-10\\\">Depending on what service the project offers, the token will serve as a kind of access ticket to that service. A crowdsale token does not grant project ownership or any voting rights.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(190,189,NULL,NULL,'<p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-14\\\">Unlike traditional crowdfunding through sites such as Kickstarter or Indiegogo, a crowdsale doesn’t pre-sell a widget or promise to put your name in the credits of a movie. Instead, it sells you something you might not know what to do with unless you are clued in: the token.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-17\\\">On the Ethereum blockchain, the token is called ether, and on the Bitcoin blockchain, it is called bitcoin. These blockchains consist of cryptographically secured blocks. A new block is created for each trade made.</p><p>You can access the blockchain by opening an account with any brokerage firm that allows cryptoinvestments. These include eToro, Coinbase, and Robinhood.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-22\\\">Say the project is a mobile app that lets you find ridesharing partners. You might use the tokens you buy to pay for your rides. Conversely, if you are the owner of the vehicle and you give someone a ride, you may be paid tokens by the network. So the tokens are a kind of currency for use within a specific digital service.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-25\\\">The crowdsale generally happens before a project has officially launched its service. It is designed to generate funds for the development of the project, helping to pay for software developers, marketing budgets, and all the other things a startup needs. Some crowdsales accept Altcoin as the currency.

And as the use of cryptocurrency hits record highs, more people want to get their own piece of the potential.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-4\\\">To purchase cryptocurrency, you’ll have to use an exchange, which is essentially a website where you can trade one currency for another currency. For example, you would use an exchange to trade U.S. dollars for Bitcoin, Ripple, or another cryptocurrency that you’re interested in purchasing. If you’ve landed on an exchange that accepts credit cards, you might consider using one for your purchase. </p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-7\\\">However, using your credit card to purchase cryptocurrency isn’t like using your credit card to purchase a book from the bookstore. It’s riskier and more expensive. Learn about how the process works and the potential drawbacks to expect. </p><h2 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-9\\\">Can You Buy Crypto With a Credit Card?</h2><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-11\\\">You can purchase cryptocurrency with a credit card if your card issuer and payment network allows the transaction type. With American Express, for example, cryptocurrency purchases are allowed, treated as a cash advance, and may be subject to a cash advance limit. In April 2021, Chase will start counting purchases of cryptocurrency as a cash advance transaction, too. </p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-14\\\">Credit card issuers that do block the purchase of cryptocurrency have varying reasons. Capital One, for example, made the decision to decline cryptocurrency purchases to protect cardholders from fraud, losses, and market volatility.<sup>3</sup> You can check with your credit card issuer to find out whether they’ve blocked cryptocurrency purchases before initiating a transaction.</p><p><strong><em>NOTE: </em></strong>Coinbase—one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges—lists only bank accounts, debit card, wire transfer, and PayPal as acceptable payment methods to link to your account; however, there are limitations to what you can do with a wire transfer and PayPal.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(194,193,NULL,NULL,'<p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-20\\\">Before using your credit card to purchase cryptocurrency—or before purchasing cryptocurrency at all—you should know how the process works and the potential fees associated with it. </p><h3 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-23\\\">You May Have to Pay a Transaction Fee</h3><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-25\\\">The cryptocurrency exchange may charge a transaction fee when you use a credit card or a debit card to purchase cryptocurrency, which they will disclose to you at the time of your transaction. Using ACH (your checking account and routing information) takes a few days to post to your account, but it’s usually free. You’ll have to make a choice between fast and expensive, or slow and free. Rushing to buy because you think prices may go up again may not be the wisest decision.</p><h3 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-28\\\">The Purchase May Be a Cash Advance</h3><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-30\\\">If the transaction is processed as a cash advance, as the case is with American Express, you’ll pay a cash advance fee on top of any transaction fee the cryptocurrency exchange charges. The typical cash advance fee on a credit card is either $5 or 10% of the amount of the transaction, whichever is greater. So, if you use your credit card to purchase $1,000 of cryptocurrency, you could pay a $100 fee to your credit card issuer.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-33\\\">You’ll also be subject to the higher cash advance APR on your credit card and you won’t get a grace period, even if you use a credit card with a zero balance. If this is the case, you’ll start incurring interest from the day you make the transaction.</p><p>As a result of the potential fees, using a credit card to buy cryptocurrency is much more expensive than regular purchases. The purchase won’t earn rewards or help you reach the spending requirements for earning a sign-up bonus on a new credit card.</p><h3 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-38\\\">There Could Be a Foreign Transaction Fee</h3><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-40\\\">If the cryptocurrency exchange is based outside the U.S., you could incur a foreign transaction fee. Foreign transaction fees, charged by your credit card issuer, are typically 3% of the transaction amount. That’s a $30 foreign transaction fee for every $1,000 of cryptocurrency you purchase.</p><h3 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-43\\\">You May Have a Daily Limit</h3><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-45\\\">Depending on the platform, there may be a limit to the amount of cryptocurrency you can purchase. Check your account settings after logging into your cryptocurrency exchange account to verify your limits.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(195,194,NULL,NULL,'<p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-49\\\">Purchasing and investing in cryptocurrency is often considered a risky move. While there are many benefits to purchasing cryptocurrency, when it comes to buying with a credit card, you should be aware of potential drawbacks.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-52\\\">Your Credit Card Information Could Be at Risk</h3><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-54\\\">Many cryptocurrency exchanges are scams and prey on people&#8217;s eagerness to earn a profit, so it’s important to research thoroughly before you make any cryptocurrency purchases. Of course, credit card fraud protection eliminates your liability for fraudulent purchases made on your credit card. Still, you want to be sure you&#8217;re not being scammed no matter what payment method you use.</p><h3 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-57\\\">Your Credit Score Could Be Impacted</h3><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-59\\\">Credit utilization—the amount of credit you use—is a major factor in your credit score. The more of your credit you use, the more it affects your credit score. Running up a big credit card balance on cryptocurrency is likely to be damaging to your credit score. It’s even worse if you charge more than you can afford to pay and fall behind on your payments.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(196,195,NULL,NULL,'<p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-1\\\">Market cap is one of those industry terms that are common enough for most people to have heard of but is “insider” enough that the average person doesn&#8217;t know what it means. I remember trying to decipher these investing terms when I was starting out and it can be difficult.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-4\\\">So, let’s start with a definition of what market cap does and why it’s valuable in traditional markets, and then we’ll get into looking at Bitcoin market cap and what you need to watch out for there.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(197,196,NULL,NULL,'<p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-8\\\">Market cap is short for market capitalization. This is a reference used by investors to figure out how big a company is. The way that market capitalization is figured is to multiply the number of shares available by how much the shares are selling for.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-11\\\">For example, a company that has 1 million shares that are selling for $50 each has a market cap of $50 million.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-14\\\">Generally speaking, the bigger the market cap of a company the more stable the investment. There are several factors that can influence an investment beyond the market cap, but many investors use market capitalization as a tool to help them know where to invest and how risky the investment is.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-17\\\">In traditional stock,s companies that have a market cap of 10 billion or more are considered large-cap companies. Market caps of between 2 billion and 10 billion are considered mid-cap companies with more room for growth. And market caps of between 300 million to 2 million are considered small-cap companies and are generally riskier investments.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-20\\\">With the growth of cryptocurrency, people are starting to look at market caps in crypto markets as well. But because crypto is largely unregulated at this point, there are additional considerations to take into account before considering market capitalization as a primary indicator of risk.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(198,197,NULL,NULL,'<p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-24\\\">Bitcoin market cap and other cryptocurrency market caps are being used to compare the value of various cryptocurrency companies.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-27\\\">But there are some serious problems with this approach. It’s not that market cap is not a useful tool forthe cryptocurrency, it can be. But it’s important to recognize that cryptocurrencies come with risk factors not associated with the traditional stock market, and to understand how to compensate for those risks.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-30\\\">One of the most important risk factors to look at when evaluating market cap for cryptocurrency is nonliquidity in the markets. This usually happens because certain parts of crypto are locked up or lost.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(199,198,NULL,NULL,'<p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-34\\\">The biggest problem with using market capitalization as a measure of how strong a particular cryptocurrency is (like you would for a publicly traded company) is that there are many situations where units of the cryptocurrency are not in liquid circulation.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-37\\\">These locked up or lost cryptocurrency units can affect what the real market cap is of any cryptocurrency.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-40\\\">When you’re looking at Bitcoin market cap, for example, it’s important to take into consideration that somewhere around 4 million Bitcoins are lost on servers somewhere. That’s according to a study from Chainalysis––a blockchain analytics company.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-43\\\">So, when you look at standard market cap valuation of how much each Bitcoin is worth times how many Bitcoin’s there are, you really should take out the “missing” Bitcoin to see how much the company is actually worth.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-46\\\">Another example of this is the company Steem. Their market cap was valued at more than $400 million. But a huge portion of their value was locked up in something called Steem Power––a kind of social network. Which means that the market capitalization value was incredibly misleading.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-49\\\">Sharks can also create misleading market capitalizations. In many cases – especially with smaller cryptocurrencies – a single entity will hold on to much of the coin from the very beginning of its existence. If these sharks then dump all of that cryptocurrency onto the market at once it can devalue it really fast.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-52\\\">The bottom line here is that when you’re looking at market capitalization for the cryptocurrency, you need to make sure that you’re looking at additional metrics as well. Especially since cryptocurrency &#8211; at this point &#8211; can still be very volatile.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(200,199,NULL,NULL,'<p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-56\\\">Now that we&#8217;ve looked at why market cap can be somewhat misleading when comparing cryptocurrencies, let&#8217;s look at some important metrics you should consider when comparing and evaluating cryptocurrencies.</p><h2 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-58\\\">Metcalfe’s Law</h2><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-60\\\">When it comes to comparing cryptocurrencies, the first metric that you probably should watch outside of market cap is called Metcalfe&#8217;s Law. This has to do with the number of users that are actually on a crypto trading network.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-63\\\">When you track the number of users on the Bitcoin network (or other networks), it will mirror closely the amount of movement on that network. It seems that removing users that have not made any transactions, but have just registered can make this law even more robust. Because then you are tracking users that are actually active.</p><h2 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-65\\\">A Warning on Metcalfe&#8217;s Law</h2><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-67\\\">Like other things, Metcalfe’s Law is not incorruptible. It can be easily gamed where there are networks that have really low transaction fees. Super low transaction fees mean that there’s less resistance to using the platform and potentially less actual trading going on, and that can screw up the law.</p><h2 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-69\\\">Liquidity</h2><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-71\\\">A second metric to watch when comparing cryptocurrencies is liquidity. I touched on this earlier in the article, but you want to make sure that you are evaluating how much trading is actually going on in any given cryptocurrency. A lack of trading could signify sharks that could dump their coins and create a drop in the market.</p><h2 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-73\\\">Monthly Volumes</h2><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-75\\\">The final metric I recommend watching is monthly volumes. Staying away from daily volumes is a really good idea. Daily volumes can be deceiving due to their volatility.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-78\\\">Cryptocurrency is still a fairly volatile investment – and some people would even say it’s a gamble. Before investing in anything – especially bitcoin and cryptocurrency – it’s important to understand how bitcoin market cap and other cryptocurrency market caps actually work. You also need to know what your real risks are and be comfortable with the possibility of losing money.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-81\\\">Cryptocurrency is an extremely interesting and dynamic development with lots of opportunity and lots of risk. Understanding how it works is important if you’re going to invest.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(201,200,NULL,NULL,'<p>Ready to buy Bitcoin right now, but don’t have time to research a broker on a DIY basis?

At the time of writing, the parallel exchange rate of one dollar to the Naira is 1:480, according to Abokifx.</p><p>Similarly, importers that are hamstrung by the country’s rigid foreign exchange regulations, are now resorting to bitcoin when making payments online or across borders. Speaking in an interview, Lasebikan says bitcoin has also given Nigerian residents an opportunity to pay for services or utilities that the CBN usually deems unnecessary. He says:</p><blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Another thing would be for people who want to have access to resources outside the country…You want to pay for Nexflix, Apple Music. All of the things the government is aggressively clamping down on.</p></blockquote><p>The software engineer explains that Nigerian authorities had, prior to this year’s events like Endsars protests, “been oblivious to the immense potential of bitcoin.” During the lockdown period, cryptocurrency usage in Nigeria grew and the country is now ranked as one of the top cryptocurrency markets. It is events in the crypto world in the past twelve months that may have helped change the Nigerian government’s perception of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Consequently, as Lasebikan acknowledges, officials might now want to take action to slow down the adoption of digital currencies by Nigerians. According to Lasebikan, one simple way authorities can achieve this is by clamping down on centralized crypto exchanges, enforcing more rigorous KYCs or driving crypto companies out of the traditional banking infrastructure.</p><p>Still, as Lasebikan explains, this “will not kill bitcoin or the value of bitcoin” because the “majority of crypto activities happen in informal channels.” He says any clampdown will not result in the dropping of peer to peer trading which is initiated via Whatsapp or Telegram social media chat groups.</p><p>Bitcoin trading is censorship-resistant and there is no way for Nigerian authorities to stop or reverse transactions. Awareness of this and other attributes about bitcoin means the CBN and others will not succeed in any effort to control the digital currency.

Foreign exchange is the process of changing one currency into another currency for a variety of reasons, usually for commerce, trading, or tourism. According to a recent triennial report from the Bank for International Settlements (a global bank for national central banks), the average was more than $5.1 trillion in daily forex trading volume.<sup>1</sup></p><h3 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block-callout-heading_1-0\\\">KEY TAKEAWAYS</h3><ul><li>The foreign exchange (also known as FX or forex) market is a global marketplace for exchanging national currencies against one another.</li><li>Because of the worldwide reach of trade, commerce, and finance, forex markets tend to be the largest and most liquid asset markets in the world.</li><li>Currencies trade against each other as exchange rate pairs. For example, EUR/USD.</li><li>Forex markets exist as spot (cash) markets as well as derivatives markets offering forwards, futures, options, and currency swaps.</li><li>Market participants use forex to hedge against international currency and interest rate risk, to speculate on geopolitical events, and to diversify portfolios, among several other reasons.</li></ul><h2 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-4\\\">What Is the Forex Market?</h2><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-5\\\">The foreign exchange market is where currencies are traded. Currencies are important to most people around the world, whether they realize it or not, because currencies need to be exchanged in order to conduct foreign trade and business. If you are living in the U.S. and want to buy cheese from France, either you or the company that you buy the cheese from has to pay the French for the cheese in euros (EUR). This means that the U.S. importer would have to exchange the equivalent value of U.S. dollars (USD) into euros. The same goes for traveling. A French tourist in Egypt can&#8217;t pay in euros to see the pyramids because it&#8217;s not the locally accepted currency. As such, the tourist has to exchange the euros for the local currency, in this case the Egyptian pound, at the current exchange rate.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-7\\\">One unique aspect of this international market is that there is no central marketplace for foreign exchange. Rather, currency trading is conducted electronically over-the-counter (OTC), which means that all transactions occur via computer networks between traders around the world, rather than on one centralized exchange. The market is open 24 hours a day, five and a half days a week, and currencies are traded worldwide in the major financial centers of London, New York, Tokyo, Zurich, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Singapore, Paris and Sydney—across almost every time zone. This means that when the trading day in the U.S. ends, the forex market begins anew in Tokyo and Hong Kong. As such, the forex market can be extremely active any time of the day, with price quotes changing constantly.</p><h2 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-9\\\">A Brief History of Forex</h2><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-10\\\">Unlike stock markets, which can trace their roots back centuries, the forex market as we understand it today is a truly new market. Of course, in its most basic sense—that of people converting one currency to another for financial advantage—forex has been around since nations began minting currencies. But the modern forex markets are a modern invention. After the accord at Bretton Woods in 1971, more major currencies were allowed to float freely against one another. The values of individual currencies vary, which has given rise to the need for foreign exchange services and trading.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-12\\\">Commercial and investment banks conduct most of the trading in the forex markets on behalf of their clients, but there are also speculative opportunities for trading one currency against another for professional and individual investors.</p><h2 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-14\\\">Spot Market and the Forwards &amp; Futures Markets&nbsp;</h2><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-15\\\">There are actually three ways that institutions, corporations and individuals trade forex: the spot market, the forwards market, and the futures market. Forex trading in the spot market has always been the largest market because it is the &#8220;underlying&#8221; real asset that the forwards and futures markets are based on. In the past, the futures market was the most popular venue for traders because it was available to individual investors for a longer period of time. However, with the advent of electronic trading and numerous forex brokers, the spot market has witnessed a huge surge in activity and now surpasses the futures market as the preferred trading market for individual investors and speculators. When people refer to the forex market, they usually are referring to the spot market. The forwards and futures markets tend to be more popular with companies that need to hedge their foreign exchange risks out to a specific date in the future.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-17\\\">More specifically, the spot market is where currencies are bought and sold according to the current price. That price, determined by supply and demand, is a reflection of many things, including current interest rates, economic performance, sentiment towards ongoing political situations (both locally and internationally), as well as the perception of the future performance of one currency against another. When a deal is finalized, this is known as a &#8220;spot deal.&#8221; It is a bilateral transaction by which one party delivers an agreed-upon currency amount to the counter party and receives a specified amount of another currency at the agreed-upon exchange rate value. After a position is closed, the settlement is in cash. Although the spot market is commonly known as one that deals with transactions in the present (rather than the future), these trades actually take two days for settlement.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-19\\\">Unlike the spot market, the forwards and futures markets do not trade actual currencies. Instead they deal in contracts that represent claims to a certain currency type, a specific price per unit and a future date for settlement.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-21\\\">In the forwards market, contracts are bought and sold OTC between two parties, who determine the terms of the agreement between themselves.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-23\\\">In the futures market, futures contracts are bought and sold based upon a standard size and settlement date on public commodities markets, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In the U.S., the National Futures Association regulates the futures market. Futures contracts have specific details, including the number of units being traded, delivery and settlement dates, and minimum price increments that cannot be customized. The exchange acts as a counterpart to the trader, providing clearance and settlement.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-25\\\">Both types of contracts are binding and are typically settled for cash at the exchange in question upon expiry, although contracts can also be bought and sold before they expire. The forwards and futures markets can offer protection against risk when trading currencies. Usually, big international corporations use these markets in order to hedge against future exchange rate fluctuations, but speculators take part in these markets as well.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-27\\\">Note that you&#8217;ll often see the terms: FX, forex, foreign-exchange market, and currency market. These terms are synonymous and all refer to the forex market.</p><h2 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-29\\\">Forex for Hedging</h2><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-30\\\">Companies doing business in foreign countries are at risk due to fluctuations in currency values when they buy or sell goods and services outside of their domestic market. Foreign exchange markets provide a way to hedge currency risk by fixing a rate at which the transaction will be completed.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-32\\\">To accomplish this, a trader can buy or sell currencies in the forward or swap markets in advance, which locks in an exchange rate. For example, imagine that a company plans to sell U.S.-made blenders in Europe when the exchange rate between the euro and the dollar (EUR/USD) is €1 to $1 at parity.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-34\\\">The blender costs $100 to manufacture, and the U.S. firm plans to sell it for €150—which is competitive with other blenders that were made in Europe. If this plan is successful, the company will make $50 in profit because the EUR/USD exchange rate is even. Unfortunately, the USD begins to rise in value versus the euro until the EUR/USD exchange rate is 0.80, which means it now costs $0.80 to buy €1.00.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-36\\\">The problem the company faces is that while it still costs $100 to make the blender, the company can only sell the product at the competitive price of €150, which when translated back into dollars is only $120 (€150 X 0.80 = $120). A stronger dollar resulted in a much smaller profit than expected.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-38\\\">The blender company could have reduced this risk by shorting the euro and buying the USD when they were at parity. That way, if the dollar rose in value, the profits from the trade would offset the reduced profit from the sale of blenders. If the USD fell in value, the more favorable exchange rate will increase the profit from the sale of blenders, which offsets the losses in the trade.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-40\\\">Hedging of this kind can be done in the currency futures market. The advantage for the trader is that futures contracts are standardized and cleared by a central authority. However, currency futures may be less liquid than the forward markets, which are decentralized and exist within the interbank system throughout the world.</p><h2 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-42\\\">Forex for Speculation</h2><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-43\\\">Factors like interest rates, trade flows, tourism, economic strength, and geopolitical risk affect supply and demand for currencies, which creates daily volatility in the forex markets. An opportunity exists to profit from changes that may increase or reduce one currency&#8217;s value compared to another. A forecast that one currency will weaken is essentially the same as assuming that the other currency in the pair will strengthen because currencies are traded as pairs.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-45\\\">Imagine a trader who expects interest rates to rise in the U.S. compared to Australia while the exchange rate between the two currencies (AUD/USD) is 0.71 (it takes $0.71 USD to buy $1.00 AUD). The trader believes higher interest rates in the U.S. will increase demand for USD, and therefore the AUD/USD exchange rate will fall because it will require fewer, stronger USD to buy an AUD.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-47\\\">Assume that the trader is correct and interest rates rise, which decreases the AUD/USD exchange rate to 0.50. This means that it requires $0.50 USD to buy $1.00 AUD. If the investor had shorted the AUD and went long the USD, he or she would have profited from the change in value.</p><h2 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-49\\\">Currency as an Asset Class</h2><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-50\\\">There are two distinct features to currencies as an asset class:</p><ul id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-52\\\"><li>You can earn the interest rate differential between two currencies.</li><li>You can profit from changes in the exchange rate.</li></ul><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-54\\\">An investor can profit from the difference between two interest rates in two different economies by buying the currency with the higher interest rate and shorting the currency with the lower interest rate. Prior to the 2008 financial crisis, it was very common to short the Japanese yen (JPY) and buy British pounds (GBP) because the interest rate differential was very large. This strategy is sometimes referred to as a &#8220;carry trade.&#8221;</p><h2 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-56\\\">Why We Can Trade Currencies</h2><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-57\\\">Currency trading was very difficult for individual investors prior to the internet. Most currency traders were large multinational corporations, hedge funds or high-net-worth individuals because forex trading required a lot of capital. With help from the internet, a retail market aimed at individual traders has emerged, providing easy access to the foreign exchange markets, either through the banks themselves or brokers making a secondary market. Most online brokers or dealers offer very high leverage to individual traders who can control a large trade with a small account balance.</p><h2 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-61\\\">Forex Trading Risks</h2><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-62\\\">Trading currencies can&nbsp;be risky and complex. The interbank market has varying degrees of regulation, and forex instruments are not standardized. In some parts of the world, forex trading is almost completely unregulated.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-64\\\">The interbank market is made up of banks trading with each other around the world. The banks themselves have to determine and accept sovereign risk and credit risk, and they have established internal processes to keep themselves as safe as possible. Regulations like this are industry-imposed for the protection of each participating bank.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-66\\\">Since the market is made by each of the participating banks providing offers and bids for a particular currency, the market pricing mechanism is based on supply and demand. Because there are such large trade flows within the system, it is difficult for rogue traders to influence the price of a currency. This system helps create transparency in the market for investors with access to interbank dealing.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-68\\\">Most small retail traders trade with relatively small and semi-unregulated&nbsp;forex brokers/dealers, which can (and sometimes do) re-quote prices and even trade against their own customers. Depending on where the dealer exists, there may be some government and industry regulation, but those safeguards are inconsistent around the globe.&nbsp;</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-70\\\">Most retail investors should spend time investigating a forex dealer to find out whether it is regulated in the U.S. or the U.K. (dealers in the U.S. and U.K. have more oversight) or in a country with lax rules and oversight. It is also a good idea to find out what kind of account protections are available in case of a market crisis, or if a dealer becomes insolvent.</p><h2 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-72\\\">Pros and Challenges of Trading Forex</h2><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-73\\\"><strong>Pro</strong>: The forex markets are the largest in terms of daily trading volume in the world and therefore offer the most liquidity.<sup>2</sup> This makes it easy to enter and exit a position in any of the major currencies within a fraction of a second for a small spread in most market conditions.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-75\\\"><strong>Challenge</strong>: Banks, brokers, and dealers in the forex markets allow a high amount of leverage, which means that traders can control large positions with relatively little money of their own. Leverage in the range of 100:1 is a high ratio but not uncommon in forex. A trader must understand the use of leverage and the risks that leverage introduces in an account. Extreme amounts of leverage have led to many dealers becoming insolvent unexpectedly.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-77\\\"><strong>Pro</strong>:&nbsp;The forex market is traded 24 hours a day, five days a week—starting each day in Australia and ending in New York. The major centers are Sydney, Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo, Frankfurt, Paris, London, and New York.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-79\\\"><strong>Challenge</strong>: Trading currencies productively requires an understanding of economic fundamentals and indicators. A currency trader needs to have a big-picture understanding of the economies of the various countries and their inter-connectedness to grasp the fundamentals that drive currency values.</p><h2 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-81\\\">The Bottom Line</h2><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-82\\\">For traders — especially those with limited funds — day trading or swing trading in small amounts is easier in the forex market than other markets. For those with longer-term horizons and larger funds, long-term fundamentals-based trading or a carry trade can be profitable. A focus on understanding the macroeconomic fundamentals driving currency values and experience with technical analysis may help new forex traders to become more profitable.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(219,218,NULL,NULL,'<p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0\\\">The forex (FX) market has many similarities to the equity markets; however, there are some key differences. This article will show you those differences and help you get started in forex trading.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-2\\\">If you&#8217;ve decided to take a stab at forex trading, access to currency markets has never been easier with a wide range of online brokerage platforms offering everything from spot trading to futures and CFDs.</p><h3 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block-callout-heading_1-0\\\">KEY TAKEAWAYS</h3><ul><li>Before you settle on a forex broker, carry out your due diligence and make sure you are choosing the best option for yourself.</li><li>Look for low spreads and fees from a provider in a well-regulated jurisdiction that offers a suite of tools and access to leverage, among other factors.</li><li>Once you&#8217;ve chosen your broker, study up on basic forex strategies and how to properly analyze currency markets.</li><li>You may want to start with a demo account to try your strategy out and backtest before risking real money in the market.</li></ul><h2 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-6\\\">Choosing a Forex Broker</h2><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-7\\\">There are many forex brokers to choose from, just as in any other market. Here are some things to look for:</p><h3 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-9\\\">Lower spreads save you money!</h3><ul id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-10\\\"><li><em>Low Spreads<strong>.</strong></em> The spread, calculated in &#8220;pips,&#8221; is the difference between the price at which a currency can be purchased and the price at which it can be sold at any given point in time. Forex brokers don&#8217;t charge a commission, so this difference is how they make money. In comparing brokers, you will find that the difference in spreads in forex is as great as the difference in commissions in the stock arena. </li></ul><h3 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-12\\\">Make sure your broker is backed by regulatory agencies and a reliable institution!</h3><ul id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-13\\\"><li><strong><em>Quality Institution.</em> </strong>Unlike equity brokers, forex brokers are usually tied to large banks or lending institutions because of the large amounts of capital required (leverage they need to provide). Also, forex brokers should be registered with the Futures Commission Merchant (FCM) and regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). You can find this and other financial information and statistics about a forex brokerage on its website, the website of its parent company or through the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority&#8217;s BrokerCheck website. </li></ul><h3 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-15\\\">Get the tools you need to succeed!</h3><ul id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-16\\\"><li><em>Extensive Tools and Research.</em> Forex brokers offer many different trading platforms for their clients – just like brokers in other markets. These trading platforms often feature real-time charts, technical analysis tools, real-time news and data and even support for trading systems. Before committing to any broker, be sure to request free trials to test different trading platforms. Brokers usually also provide technical and fundamental information, economic calendars and other research. </li></ul><h3 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-18\\\">Leverage your bets!</h3><ul id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-19\\\"><li><em>Wide Range of Leverage Options.</em> Leverage is necessary in forex because the price deviations (the sources of profit) are merely fractions of a cent. Leverage, expressed as a ratio between total capital available to actual capital, is the amount of money a broker will lend you for trading. For example, a ratio of 100:1 means your broker would lend you $100 for every $1 of actual capital. Many brokerages offer as much as 250:1. Remember, lower leverage means lower risk of a margin call, but also lower bang for your buck (and vice-versa). </li></ul><p>If you have limited capital, make sure your broker offers high leverage through a margin account. If capital is not a problem, any broker with a wide variety of leverage options should do. A variety of options lets you vary the amount of risk you are willing to take. For example, less leverage (and therefore less risk) may be preferable for highly volatile (exotic) currency pairs.</p><h3 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-23\\\">Make sure your broker uses the proper leverage, tools, and services relative to your amount of capital.</h3><ul id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-24\\\"><li><em>Account Types.</em>&nbsp;Many brokers offer two or more types of accounts. The smallest account is known as a mini account and requires you to trade with a minimum of, say, $250, offering a high amount of leverage (which you need in order to make money with this size of initial capital). The standard account lets you trade at a variety of different leverages, but it requires a minimum of $2,000. Finally, premium accounts, which often require significantly higher amounts of capital, let you use different amounts of leverage and often offer additional tools and services.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-26\\\">Broker Actions to Avoid in Forex Trading</h2><ul id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-27\\\"><li><em>Sniping or Hunting.</em> Sniping and hunting – defined as prematurely buying or selling near preset points – are inappropriate acts committed by brokers to increase profits. Unfortunately, the only way to determine the brokers that do this and those that do not is to talk to fellow traders. There is no blacklist or organization that reports such activity. </li><li><em>Strict Margin Rules.</em>When you are trading with borrowed money, your broker has a say in how much risk you take. As such, your broker can buy or sell at their discretion, which can be a bad thing for you. Let&#8217;s say you have a margin account, and your position takes a dive before rebounding to all-time highs. Even if you have enough cash to cover, some brokers will liquidate your position on a margin call at that low. This action on their part can cost you a significant amount of capital. </li></ul><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-29\\\">Be sure to conduct thorough due diligence prior to selecting a broker! Once you&#8217;ve decided, signing up for a forex account is similar to getting an equity account. The only major difference is that for forex accounts, you are required to sign a margin agreement. This agreement states that you are trading with borrowed money, and, as such, the brokerage has the right to intervene in your trades to protect its interests. That said, once you sign up and fund your account, you&#8217;ll be ready to trade.</p><h2 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-31\\\">Defining a Basic Forex Trading Strategy</h2><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-32\\\">Technical analysis and fundamental analysis are two of the oft-used strategies in the forex market. Technical analysis is by far the most common strategy used by individual forex traders, which we&#8217;ll explain in further detail below.</p><h3 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-34\\\">Fundamental Analysis</h3><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-35\\\">If you think it&#8217;s difficult to value one company, try valuing a whole country! Fundamental analysis in the forex market is very complex, and is often used only to predict long-term trends; however, some traders do trade short term strictly on news releases. There are many fundamental indicators of currency values released at many different times such as:</p><ul id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-37\\\"><li><em>Non-farm Payrolls</em></li><li><em>Purchasing Managers Index (PMI)</em></li><li><em>Consumer Price Index (CPI)</em></li><li><em>Retail Sales</em></li><li><em>Durable Goods</em></li></ul><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-39\\\">These reports are not the only fundamental factors to watch. There are also several meetings where quotes and commentary can affect markets just as much as any report. These meetings are often called to discuss interest rates, inflation, and other issues that affect currency valuations. Even changes in wording when addressing certain issues—the Federal Reserve chairman&#8217;s comments on interest rates, for example—can cause market volatility. Therefore, two important meetings for forex traders to watch are the Federal Open Market Committee and Humphrey Hawkins Hearings.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-41\\\">Simply reading the reports and examining the commentary can help forex fundamental analysts gain a better understanding of long-term market trends and allow short-term traders to profit from extraordinary events. If you choose to follow a fundamental strategy, be sure to keep an economic calendar handy at all times so you know when these reports are released. Your broker may also provide real-time access to this type of information.</p><h3 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-43\\\">Technical Analysis</h3><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-44\\\">Technical analysts of the forex analyze price trends, similar to their counterparts in the equity markets. The only key difference between technical analysis in forex and technical analysis in equities is the timeframe, as forex markets are open 24 hours a day. As a result, some forms of technical analysis that factor in time must be modified to factor in the 24-hour forex market. These are some of the most common forms of technical analysis used in forex:</p><ul id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-46\\\"><li><em>The Elliott Waves</em></li><li><em>Fibonacci Studies</em></li><li><em>Parabolic SAR</em></li><li><em>Pivot points</em></li></ul><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-48\\\">Many technical analysts combine these studies to make more accurate predictions. (i.e., the common practice of combining the Fibonacci studies with Elliott Waves.) Others create trading systems to repeatedly locate similar buying and selling conditions.</p><h2 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-50\\\">Finding Your Forex Trading Strategy</h2><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-51\\\">Most successful traders develop a strategy and perfect it over time. Some focus on one particular study or calculation, while others use broad spectrum analysis to determine their trades.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-53\\\">Most experts suggest trying a combination of both fundamental and technical analysis in order to make long-term projections and determine entry and exit points. That said, it is the individual trader who needs to decide what works best for him or her (most often through trial and error) in the end.</p><h2 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-55\\\">Forex Trading Considerations to Remember</h2><ul id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-56\\\"><li><strong><em>Open a demo account and paper trade until you can make a consistent profit.</em></strong> Many people jump into the forex market and quickly lose a lot of money due to taking on too much leverage. It is important to take your time and learn to trade properly before committing capital.</li><li><strong><em>Trade without emotion.</em></strong> Don&#8217;t keep &#8220;mental&#8221; stop-loss points if you don&#8217;t have the ability to execute them on time. Always set your stop-loss and take-profit points to execute automatically, and don&#8217;t change them unless absolutely necessary.</li><li><strong><em>The trend can be your friend.</em></strong> If you go against the trend, make sure you have a good reason. That&#8217;s because you have a higher chance of success in trading with the trend because the forex market tends to move in that direction than the other.</li></ul><h2 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-58\\\">The Bottom Line</h2><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-59\\\">The forex market is the largest market in the world, and individuals are becoming increasingly interested in plying their trade in FX. However, there are multiple considerations to take into account before you begin trading, such as being sure your broker meets certain criteria and understanding a trading strategy that works best for you. One way to learn to trade forex is to open up a demo account and try it out.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(220,219,NULL,NULL,'<p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0\\\">Trading in any investment market is very difficult as evidenced by the fact that most beginning traders lose money. However, success can be found with enough of the right education, practice, and experience. So, what is currency trading and is it right for you?</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-2\\\">The currency market, or forex (FX), is the largest investment market in the world and continues to grow annually. On April 2010, the forex market reached <strong>$4 trillion</strong> in daily average turnover, an increase of 20% since 2007.<sup>1</sup></p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-4\\\">In comparison, there is only $25 billion of daily volume on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The market may be large, but until recently the volume came from professional traders, but as currency trading platforms have improved more retail traders have found forex to be suitable for their investment goals.</p><h3 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block-callout-heading_1-0\\\">KEY TAKEAWAYS</h3><ul><li>Forex exchanges allow for 24/7 trading in currency pairs, making it the world&#8217;s largest and most liquid asset market.</li><li>While it is the largest market in the world, a relatively small number (~20) of currency pairs are responsible for the majority of volume and activity.</li><li>Currencies are traded against one another as pairs (e.g., EUR/USD) and each pair is typically quoted in pips (percentage in points) out to four decimal places.</li><li>Currency prices fluctuate based on the economic situation of the countries involved, geopolitical risk and instability, and trade &amp; financial flows, among other factors.</li></ul><h2 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-8\\\">How Does it Work?</h2><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-9\\\">Currency trading is a 24-hour market that is only closed from Friday evening to Sunday evening, but the 24-hour trading sessions are misleading. There are three sessions that include the European, Asian and United States trading sessions.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-11\\\">Although there is some overlap in the sessions, the main currencies in each market are traded mostly during those market hours. This means that certain currency pairs will have more volume during certain sessions. Traders who stay with pairs based on the dollar will find the most volume in the U.S. trading session.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-13\\\">Currency is traded in various sized lots. The micro-lot is 1,000 units of a currency. If your account is funded in U.S. dollars, a micro lot represents $1,000 of your base currency, the dollar. A mini lot is 10,000 units of your base currency and a standard lot is 100,000 units.</p><h2 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-17\\\">Pairs and Pips</h2><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-18\\\">All currency trading is done in pairs. Unlike the stock market, where you can buy or sell a single stock, you have to buy one currency and sell another currency in the forex market. Next, nearly all currencies are priced out to the fourth decimal point. A pip or percentage in point is the smallest increment of trade. One pip typically equals 1/100 of 1%.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-20\\\">Retail or beginning traders often trade currency in micro lots, because one pip in a micro lot represents only a 10-cent move in the price. This makes losses easier to manage if a trade doesn&#8217;t produce the intended results. In a mini lot, one pip equals $1 and that same one pip in a standard lot equals $10. Some currencies move as much as 100 pips or more in a single trading session making the potential losses to the small investor much more manageable by trading in micro or mini lots.</p><h2 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-22\\\">Far Fewer Products</h2><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-23\\\">The majority of the volume in currency trading is confined to only 18 currency pairs compared to the thousands of stocks that are available in the global equity markets. Although there are other traded pairs outside of the 18, the eight currencies most often traded are the U.S. dollar (USD), Canadian dollar (CAD), euro (EUR), British pound (GBP), Swiss franc (CHF), New Zealand dollar (NZD), Australian dollar (AUD) and the Japanese yen (JPY). Although nobody would say that currency trading is easy, having far fewer trading options makes trade and portfolio management an easier task.</p><h2 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-25\\\">What Moves Currencies?</h2><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-26\\\">An increasing amount of stock traders are taking interest in the currency markets because many of the forces that move the stock market also move the currency market. One of the largest is supply and demand. When the world needs more dollars, the value of the dollar increases and when there are too many circulating, the price drops.</p><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-28\\\">Other factors like interest rates, new economic data from the largest countries and geopolitical tensions, are just a few of the events that may affect currency prices.</p><h2 id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-30\\\">The Bottom Line</h2><p id=\\\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-31\\\">Much like anything in the investing market, learning about currency trading is easy but finding the winning trading strategies takes a lot of practice. Most forex brokers will allow you to open a free virtual account that allows you to trade with virtual money until you find strategies that will help you become a successful forex trader.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(221,220,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(222,221,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(223,222,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(224,223,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(225,224,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(226,225,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(227,226,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(228,227,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(229,228,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(230,229,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(231,230,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(232,231,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(233,232,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(234,233,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(235,234,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(236,235,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(237,236,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(238,237,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(239,238,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(240,239,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(241,240,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(242,241,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(243,242,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(244,243,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(245,244,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(246,245,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(247,246,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(248,247,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(249,248,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(250,249,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);
